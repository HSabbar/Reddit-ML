      "what's the simplest video resource to have ln up and running? just want to try it out https://staging.lightning.engineering/sidecar-channel-blog/posts/2021-05-25-sidecar-channels/ when you want to onboard a stranger/friend onto bitcoin, you can just send them some coins on-chain. if they then want to use ln, they need to do another transaction to (possibly) move those funds into an ln wallet, then open a channel. what we've released today lets your friend _skip_ the normal on-chain flow and go _directly_ to layer 2 (lightning). under the hood, it uses [pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool/) to source a liquidity provider (who is ideally a well connected and well run routing node) to open an initial channel to them in an atomic operation. the channel opened may even have funds on both sides to let your friend receive/send using the channel as soon as it's confirmed. as all operations on pool are batched together in a single transaction, in aggregate more people can be on boarded onto w/ less chain fees spent compared to if they all did it by themselves in isolation. how profitable is it to run a lightning node? can i easily deploy some btc to generate income, like lending on defi? hi, tldr: is it possible to use ln to accept payments only and withdraw to layer1 btc? ---------- in 2017 bull run i got interested in lightning. created a lightning wallet and experimented with it made some purchases online. it workwd very well and fees were nearly 0. so far i was very happy with that. but when i wanted to use lightning to accept payment in my bussiness it became a problem. if i want to accept payments in ln i have to first lock my bitcoins ans spend them to free up space so i cam recieve money from someone else. that was really unusable. i was able to solve this by using a 3rd party servise which holds btc on ln for me. but i can again only spend it, i am not able to turn it back to layer1 btc. is there an easy solution now or is it still the same? i guess if i operate my own ln node it would be different but i am not an it guy i am looking for easy solutions 😉 and we need easy solutions if we want more people to use btc and lightning. i'm not too tech savvy but i want to contribute to the ln. is there a ready-to-run solution for ln nodes, that i can run on windows server or something? never used linux yet. i could get my hands on a cheap mac mini (my2010) that i would like to use to run a node. i'm ok to do a clean install of ubuntu on it, so i won't be using osx. is this a good idea or should i rather go the raspberry pi route like most people? hi there. how would a little website set up a bitcoin node to allow customers pay through the lightning network? is it complicated as i am not a wiz kid like most here 😀 blockchain : bitcoin to run an ln node easily on a raspi or linux: https://getumbrel.com/ for ln news you can follow: [https://twitter.com/btc\\_ln](https://twitter.com/btc_ln) and r/thelightningnetwork\n",
