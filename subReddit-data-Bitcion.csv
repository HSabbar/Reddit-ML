0;Best hardware wallet?;nla5z5;16;1622010630.0;Negative_Comedian870;"Hey guys. 

Seeing lots of people on the Ledger sub having their BTC emptied mysteriously, I am going to switch to another HW wallet.

Any ideas on which is best?";16;"I personaly use trezor, but i think the only problem with ledger lately has been the company data breaches. User data being leaked was probably the reason some of the users lost their crypto. Falling for fake emails etc. There shouldn't be a need to get a new wallet just be cautious. Coldcard is easily the best Bitcoin wallet, but Trezor is pretty solid. Trezor Model T For BTC only - consider Coldcard. So, just because some users fall for phishing attacks, you don't trust the hardware? The users are the weakest link, not the hardware. What stories? Do any show a problem with ledger hardware? Or the people using them? Got a ledger and BTC is still there. To be honest, I don‚Äôt think you need to change the hardware wallet. The people that have their bitcoin emptied out had their seed compromised or someone guessed it (which is unlikely and it can also happen to Trezor). If you had bought it before the hack they suffered and now have your personal data compromised, changing the hardware wallet won‚Äôt change that. I would just stick with the ledger hardware wallet that you have, and buy a only when that one breaks down I like Bitbox02 and Coldcard I like my Coldcard Check out the [BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.ch/).

https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/security-features/

Disclaimer: I work for Shift, let me know if you have any specific questions. For large bitcoin hold coldcard + Electrum only defect it's BTC only, but provides plausible deniability.

For mobile practical crypto everyday (coins you can lost on intimidation ransom escenario) trezor+mycelium

Trezor also Is excellent with alts as Long you use it with desktop metamask and never ever expose it physical control as it doesn't have an secure element.

Can't recommend anything specific to hodl large amount of alts, at least not at the same security level as coldcard+Electrum.

*Disclaimer: this information for all purposes and intends is provided as anecdotal, consider it at own risc* I just purchased a Trezor One myself as I just plan to hodl and not do much trading. I like the open source aspect of the firmware. Does anyone have anything to say about the Trezor One? I personally use trezor aswell i think its great and has had no hiccups at all.

Would definately recommend. + it has its own exchange in a way that allows you to buy certain crypto but not sell.

Should check it out. No. Online it should be safe if you use many sets of protections like authenticator and confirmations so that nobody can really access your account."
1;IT Giant Globant Joins Buys $500,000 Worth of Bitcoin;nkmhp2;36;1621938559.0;VAMPXIII;;10;"People here acting like 10 BTC is a small quantity when they see other companies buying Millions of $$ worth. 10 BTC is a huge amount only 2.1M entities will ever be able to have 10BTC, BTC is just insanely undervalued.

Bob immediately buys 1 BTC for $40K. Later, Bob sells 1 BTC for $150K. Now he must pay cap. gains on $110K profit, instead of $90K profit (which he would have realized had he not sold at $40K). ""POOF"" goes Bob's ""tax break.""

Sounds like Bob complicated his taxes, likely flagged the IRS to audit him, paid exchange fees to sell, exchange fees to re-buy, plus transaction fee to send his BTC to the exchange. Bob had to take a chance that the LTCG rate would not increase between the time he ""reset"" his BTC cost basis and the time he sold it. Bob is shaking his head, saying, ""Not worth it."""

7;The campaign of the haters who sold at 33K or didn't buy the dip, on Twitter right now?;nlanp6;14;1622012686.0;Glow-fly;"I am noticing that when people say on Twitter that Bitcoin is heading to 52K now, then many people reply ""yes, and after that drop to 20 or 25 K"". Many, many, many replies like that on the twitter. Is there any logic that Bitcoin may do so, or this is just a campaign of haters who sold at 33K level or those who was waiting to buy at the huge discount?";12;"Do your own T/A for bullish/bearish situations. Think about this. 

Why are these haters here? Does it make sense to talk down an asset that you have no interest in buying? 

When I'm buying a second hand car, I'm obviously going to point out to the dealer all of the things I see are broken. I think it it's a bit like that. 

The tsunami of FUD really only tells me that there's a lot of money waiting to get in. Imagine how many opinions and price predictions are from people who don't even own BTC. Think long term, ignore the daily noise.

üöÄ I think 32 was as low as it was gonna get , people should have bought not sold ! One of the reasons I got off Twitter; Reddit is more about presentation and twitters just like shooting from the hip. Imo

And I‚Äôm always wrong but I think 32 is our bottom Nobody knows what will happen. Don't get into this with money you need. Put it money that you can afford to lose. Personally from what I've read I think this has the power to change the world. Give billions of people access to a bank when their country wouldn't allow it. Women in the middle east for instance are not allowed to have their own bank account. Don't listen to what others have to say when they obviously can't know. Also make your own mind about your investments and DYOR.

BTC chart often helps with making decisions. Or look at it from a different angle - you can‚Äôt shut those FUDders up and you can‚Äôt prevent others from panic selling based on Twitter FUD. What you could do if you have conviction is to accelerate your accumulation whilst the market is still in this mode.

And perhaps the FUDders are doing exactly that. 1 - don't listen to strangers on the Internet they don't know anything. 
2 - momentum is more likely to continue, currently momentum is downward. 
3 - it is very very common to get a dead cat/bull trap bounce after a large correction.

Balance your portfolio accordingly. Links please, I want larping and cringe.

Popcorns ready. 20k should be the bottom and that‚Äôs when I‚Äôll buy I'm just pissed it never dips on my dca day"
8;Question for CoinPayments merchants;nm7b9b;2;1622121654.0;RealNatty;"What tools do you use for accounting the transactions with CoinPayments? 

It's my first year accepting crypto as a payment on my business and I will need to eventually account and pay taxes on any profits from cryptocurrency.  Unfortunately, CoinPayments doesn't give the option to export transactions with its real-time worth (Which I will need when the accounts are prepared, and tax is calculated. )

Also, how do you account for capital gains on current and previously accounted transactions? 

Any recommendations will be appreciated!";0;
9;ELI5: What is the coin part of Bitcoin?;nl69em;2;1621996195.0;fwz;I kind of understand what the Blockchain is and what proof of work means, but I don't fully understand the coin part. Like, how is it related to blocks on the Blockchain and why do people exchange it? Like where does the value actually come from?;9;"Belief. The belief that it's worth money is what gives it value. Much like the dollar. ""Blocks"" are simply batches of new transactions that are being written into the existing database. A blockchain is just a fancy word for a weirdly structured database.  

The coins only exist in that database in form of transactions from one address to another.  

The value that they have is a result of their properties (such as being scarce, verifiable, unconfiscatable, permissionless, borderless, immutable, highly divisible and portable etc) as well as speculation activity.  

See also the ELI5 article(s) here: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html Definitely check out the Andreas YouTube videos.

The eli5 is the same as everything else in the world: the value is discoveted by the party willing to accept it and the negotiation that follows. Marketing gimmick. It's worked very well. the coins its self is just a label to identify because we all automatically associate a coin to money.

""coins"" like bitcoin is divisible 100 000 000 times... so you can buy small portion of the coin without ever needing to own a full coin.

the coin is more of an identify or a name to say you are buying on this specific blockchain technology. so each coin or each project has a blockchain that's unique to them.

coins has a finite supply like bitcoin will only ever have 21 000 000 bitcoin EVER. so bitcoin has value because of the scarcity. (imagine you buy gold and no more gold can be mined again) it can be used for transaction around the world without a 3rd part gate keeper.  

also i can send you bitcoin 24/7 365 days of the week no matter where you are in the world. try to send me some cash while im in japan on a sunday....

the bank is probably closed and you are gona pay an arm and a leg in fee's. Magic internet money Value is a man-made concept, so all value anything has is just there in the mind of people.

Two people agreeing on some value makes a deal possible.

If a lot of people agree on something its value you could say it is widely accepted.

That is pretty much it... Blocks contain transactions. Transactions have inputs and outputs. The inputs are where the coins are from. The outputs are where the coins go to. The inputs cannot be spent again because they have been spent. The outputs, if not spent, are the coins that can be spent. In short, a coins is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO).

The value of Bitcoin comes from supply and demand. It's just the brand name."

But the rule number 10 says "" Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like ""Buying 100 BTC"" or ""Selling my computer for bitcoins"" do not belong here"".

I'm lost! Can I post my art here? There's a right or better place to do it?  
Thank you for your help in advance.";5;"I'd recommend you look at places that are focused on specifcally selling art such as NFT Marketplaces!

Send me a PM I am a huge Crypto Art Fan! Why not create a WordPress site? Not a moderator, but I would recommend only post each creation once, and then put a link to your gallery in the thread without advertising the cost here. Posting pictures of your artwork(s) is welcome as long as it is relevant to bitcoin. Link in the comments to your store/webpage is also ok (as long as it's done in a non-spammy way).  

Announcing that you have a webshop/page where you are accepting bitcoin is probably also ok as a one time thing, even if your art is not bitcoin related.  

> I read the rules and found the rule number 4 that says "" New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin"". But the rule number 10 says "" Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like ""Buying 100 BTC"" or ""Selling my computer for bitcoins"" do not belong here"".  

It just means it's not allowed here to look for counterparties for buying/selling whatever stuff. Posting a link to your webshop is different from that. This isn't really a place for art sales.  If you want to announce that you're an artist selling stuff for Bitcoin, well, you just did.

If your art itself is Bitcoin-related, someone used to post such stuff on Mondays.  If your art itself isn't Bitcoin-related, go post it someplace relevant."
11;How Regulations Could Empower The Crypto Industry - A Few Instances;nlhg0j;1;1622036811.0;thumbsdrivesmecrazy;"Often viewed as a hindrance to the market‚Äôs potential, regulations might actually empower the crypto industry. The following guide provides a few instances on how regulations can benefit the market: **[How Regulations Could Empower The Crypto Industry](https://www.oobit.com/blog/how-regulations-could-empower-the-crypto-industry/)**

* **Increase levels of certainty** to new investors, a draw card that eliminates the unpredictability for the long term feasibility.

* **Increase use cases,** as with more regulation more fiat operating merchants can start accepting cryptocurrency as payment options. The more the governments are on board, the more the use cases increase. 

* **Accountable asset ownership,** meaning that users employing cryptocurrencies for illicit activities can better be managed due to rules and regulations in place to hinder them. Which leads to:

* **More positive market overview** due to the nature in which crypto is used ‚Äì for accountable payments rather than dark web antics. Which again, circles back to the first point.";1;*Hi.  I just heard about Bitcoin.  I'm here to fix it.*
12;Some weird things going on at 40K ?;nljd6x;3;1622041937.0;mbaran187;"I suspect some specific attempts to hold btc below 40K. Do you agree ? 

It is almost a feeling, it doesnt include any technical supports for my saying. 

Do you agree ?";13;"No 40k range was strong support for months, now that we've broken below it, it becomes strong resistance. It's not a conspiracy, it's simple technical analysis I have a very strong feeling and theory about coordinated price suppression. I think it‚Äôll be happening right up until it can‚Äôt due to regulations. 

Regulation = moon travel

Tho I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with 40k specificity; 40k is just a psychological barrier I wouldn't be surprised to see it drop to $35k by the end of the week, possibly $32K, and shoot up after options expire on May 28th. >attempts to hold btc below 40K

it's called resistance , people using ""take profit"" at specific price levels to exit the market I wouldn't say specific attempts.  But it has been pinging $40k repeatedly over the last 72 hours, even staying there for much of today.

Possibly some of it is traders sitting watching the movement in order to decide whether to sell in a small profit now (presuming e.g. $32-$35k entry a week ago) or hold for greener pastures.  And when they see the sluggishness they take some profit to hedge against a deeper dive.

I don't suspect it's driven by automated TP because of the 72 hour period of repeated tags of that range.  The automated part would have been exhausted on the first $40k hit.  Unless day traders came home from work and saw the bounce, got worried, then put in a TP @ $40k for the following day :) i like oatmeal 41-42k maybe - we‚Äôve been over 40k for most of the day There's a lot of stablecoin waiting on the sidelines.  Wonder why it hasn't deployed yet.  Perhaps waiting for Bitcoin to establish over $41k or expecting another dump No.

Bitcoin also provides 0% of the the services provided by the legacy financial sector. if bitcoin is less than 5% the size of the financial sector, then this article just dunked on itself. It's also processing less than 5% of transactions of the banking system, so... And handles about a trillionth of the transactions. And it services less than 5% as many people.

You are only hurting our community by ignoring it and refusing to acknowledge it.

""Tether"".... next

""only criminals"" .... next

""dirty energy"" .... Considering the large majority of the worlds goods and dollars are perpetuated out of the global economy  it makes zero sense this is what the media has focused on. Almost as if it is propaganda... hmm. Like Wall Street cares about emissions? True, I am pretty sure the only people who think this is important are virtue tweeting while sitting in their electric car while pulling up to the hormone therapy clinic. That's right!   Good take.   

Don't allow people to critically think, but tell them what to think.... that is how you keep control. claiming ‚Äúbetter for climate‚Äù has been the concern troll for decades.

plastic better than paper.... GMO and lab grown food... electric cars... coal over nuke... 

it‚Äôs bullshit that uses money to posture the desire to do good for something that is provably harmful.

if you replace the entirety of fiat infrastructure it is not better than crypto. 

musk would make that point about electric: destroying the world for lithium is bad, yes, not mot as bad as fossil fuel How long until Bitcoin is declared racist Sounds like a good way for the super wealthy to consolidate their control of Bitcoin Soon, it‚Äôll be that Bitcoin is racist. I‚Äôll put 10 cuckbucks on that. And after this is debunked they will find something new... Wall Street is no longer against BitCoin. If Bitcoin conpletely crashes it will spill over to the stock market at this point. Hedgefunds, Banks and big conpanies have exposure. This is exactly why we will see better regulations in the coming years. I'm as bullish long term as can be. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt mine a uranium vein would you? Well would you mine a Bitcoin?

Did you know every year Bitcoin causes the earth to over heat? 

Over 200 scientists have confirmed the ice caps have melted because of bitcoins, they‚Äôre just gone now. No matter what you think it‚Äôs worth, it‚Äôs not worth the cost of human life.‚Äù  

How dare you! **This is good for Bitcoin**. 

Attention will soon turn to how much energy other industries use, and their mix of renewable energy. 

Bitcoin‚Äôs green energy is between ~35% and ~75%, depending on the season (because hydro).

For example [this video from ABC Australia](https://youtu.be/dmNHq6fD6yQ) explains how **Netflix produces 100MT of CO2** vs Bitcoin‚Äôs 37MT. Agree. Also, dirty energy Bitcoin promote proof of stake, which is cryptocurrency cancer. Ponzi scheme. Interesting conspiracy theory.  Highly doubt it. What company trying to make a profit and claim to be green wants to deal with high transaction fees and be guilty of contributing to a pollution problem? Really dumb ones run by idiots who don't understand the concept of profit and press. The only real threat to Bitcoin is if China decides to confiscate aalllll those ASICs. Then we basically have digital Yuan. Exactly! I agree and they will find something new once the dirty energy problem is over. Hear hear!! Umm... it's both lol.  Just because BTC is mined w/ dirty energy doesn't mean that criminals have stopped using it. Does criminal use dollar or any money anyways. Even better currupt government officials I mentioned about this too but in turkish 

https://youtu.be/uj3JCX1vB7g I think they are simply playing off of Elon's tweets, without considering his long game. There's no doubt that Elon loves crypto, but his stated focus has been to accelerate the shift to renewables globally. Though crypto mining is a drop in the bucket, major players in the space now have the massive piles of cash that I'm sure elon would like to see invested in renewables, and I believe many will in the coming months. 

Just a thought.. And I can't be the only one thinking this. This thread was mentioned in an article on Bitcoin News:

Also, every time NASA said they were going to go to Mars, but then funding got cut by the next administration? Yeah, he's shutting that down too. Also, we got cheap lithium ion batteries because he spent a billion dollars to build a giant plant here in the USA.

40;The Three Most Terrifying Words Associated with Bitcoin;nlj0fm;0;1622041037.0;GiantCoccyx;"There are three words related to Bitcoin that make me cringe every time I hear them.  I've begun hearing them so often during this cycle, that cringing has been replaced by projectile vomiting and instant diarrhea.  

You only hear these words when ""BTC is going up"" but you never ever hear them in the bowels of a bear market - that's what makes them especially dangerous. 

These words must be avoided at all costs and if you must run from Bitcoin if...

1. If you find yourself uttering these words.
2. If you're associated with a group of people and you hear them uttering these words.
3. If you wake up and literally FEEL the meaning of these words.
4. If these words are the MAIN reason why you're investing in Bitcoin.

**What are these words?**

# ""I ‚ù§Ô∏è BITCOIN""

Whenever I hear them I'm like; ""You ‚ù§Ô∏è bitcoin, really bruh?""  ""Like you literally ‚ù§Ô∏è BITCOIN?"" Wow.

Those who ‚ù§Ô∏è Bitcoin will never successfully be able to use it to things like get out of debt, buy land, and invest in consistently reliable cash flowing businesses.

Those who ‚ù§Ô∏è BTC will be stuck holding BTC that they bought at the top, when / if it ""goes back up"" they'll never know when the final top for this cycle is, and when the price goes down towards bear market lows, they won't ‚ù§Ô∏è BTC anymore.

Amazing.";8;"I love bitcoin perhaps because I hate fiat.

I remember trying to get into Gox to buy at 5 cents----site shut down. I get what you‚Äôre saying because I hate when people say things like ‚ÄúX is sexy‚Äù which has nothing to do with sex appeal BUT I think you have it wrong here. 

If some people can be nationalistic and patriotic and say ‚ÄúI love my country‚Äù without making you cringe then bitcoin sort of falls right in there. For many bitcoin is a freedom they wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have access to thus-  ‚ÄúI love freedom‚Äù- another one you might not cringe hearing. 

Bitcoin represents possibilities, hope, and a way for people to get away from tyranny. Bitcoin represents a way for me to store the value of my hard work and not have to worry about the trillions my government is printing out of thin air despite a mathematically impossible debt. 

I love bitcoin. Some do need to hear this. Mostly those who aren‚Äôt savvy in using the digital economy; which I guess includes these people of emotional extremes you‚Äôre referring to.

The amount of days is irrelevant without knowing your expenses (electricity cost, hardware costs, operational costs).

You can't mine bitcoin with GPUs (anymore). You need an ASIC. Even if they sell their GPus they will still be mega expensive. Buying a pre built system isn‚Äôt a bad way to go to get the gpu at a normal price. I‚Äôd you already have a pc to put it in you can sell the individual components back and you would do ok in that aspect.

https://youtu.be/0xLSvesOWGY What's the risk exactly? What does he think governments can or will do to maintain control? this is a really sophisticated way of saying have fun staying poor. It also goes along with Cathie Wood saying 40% Bitcoin  60% stocks. Opposied to the historical 40% bonds 60% stocks. 

I don't own any bonds, do the rest of you? This is a huge deal. He said he‚Äôs rather be in Bitcoin than government bonds‚Ä¶. Strong words from a persons whose words carry weight. Of course that is right:  You will make 17% over 10 years with bonds before inflation costs.  Bitcoin will for sure cover inflation costs, and it made 17% today.  Even at $60k or $100k or $400k, you will make, or given a sale opportunity, over 17% over 10 year with bitcoin

http://www.naturalfinance.net/2021/03/bitcoin-is-better-investment-than-bonds.html He just implied hyperbitcoinzation. Well yeah no shit Wasn't he against crypto? When and why did he did he change his mind? Never trust any of these big players. They flip flop all the time and manipulate markets. He has seen the Hyperbitcoinization event horizon

Also, things are VERY VERY haywire in finance, and Central Banks need to get their shit together ASAP. This is Ray Dalio giving the warning to Central Bankers. Please for the love of God do something you dumb bankers.

Step 1 would be to stop having Real Estate be so encouraged as a Store of Value. Taper that off ASAP with restrictions on how low the interest rates can be. End that. Stop it from being this ongoing drain on the future. 

Find a new Store of Value, because people need actual homes to live in. I sold all stock, cashed out cd‚Äôs, emptied my savings account and bought 50/50 crypto, gold & silver.    I don‚Äôt want to hold devalued fiat USD, I know what happens to it during a crash, with crypto and precious metals, like real estate and other physical assets you have a chance. https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/859/588/e1e.gif His goal is to make money. You don't make money holding cash or bonds. You actually lose money over time when inflation is higher than the interest rate, as is the case right now. So obviously BTC is better because there's a chance you'll make money. With risk of course. Congratulations! We converted Ray Dalio. Until he changes his mind. He could have bought it to short it because bonds are so üî• https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/even-bridgewater-associates-was-caught-flat-footed-by-the-coronavirus-market-sell-off.html **Hyperbitcoinzation** is not going to happen while dollar bonds still have value. That is only going to happen when these bonds will have become essentially worthless.

Hyperbitcoinzation will be the result of fiat hyperinflation.

At that point, the flight into bitcoin will not be perceived as a risk by the government, because their own alternative will no longer be a viable alternative.

As long as the fiat system still works, Bitcoin will not replace it. That won't happen. Bitcoin will win by default only. Who the hell is trying to decide between a bond and BTC?  lol this is a stupid statement... Bond investors and crypto bettors are exclusive clubs on opposite ends of the risk spectrum. I knew he would finally get it I sold my bonds for bitcoin some time ago. It went 10x already lol.

Maybe Dalio should have listened at the time, instead of his stupid takes back then.

Welcome to the new world tho Dalio! Bitcoin and bonds aren't remotely similar asset classes. Weird statement"

54;Stop Checking Price Strategies;nlkps3;4;1622045497.0;CreativeBoredom;"Why hodlers have the need to constantly check prices is baffling. But here I am, and I'm not alone. 

I'm starting to put more barriers between me and my crypto checking habit so it won't adversely impact other things that matter a lot, like my productivity. 

So far, I've removed apps from my phone desktop, work with my phone out of arms reach, and implement a schedule where I get to look a few times a day. It's working, but slow going.

Curious how others manage this. Would love to know and adopt other strategies that make sense. 

Thanks all and stay productive!";7;"I think its a healthy tactic to slow down monitoring. 
If your not trading theres no real need.
I only use my PC. 
Phones are designed to be too adictive for my tastes. I removed all bookmarks, shortcuts, apps etc the other day, but it didn't take me long to get them back when I started to wonder how it's doing

Even though I intend to hold long time I still check prices every 30 seconds like an addict. I enjoy the little endorphin rush even seeing a tiny +0.01% increase over the last hour There are strategies for this kind of thing from outside of crypto. Every time you want to check, make a dot on a page to see at the end of the day ""wanted to check / did check"" to visualize what you where doing and how you are doing.

Once you cannot resist, do intentionally something else (having a gummi around your wrist to snap when you are angry first instead of going angry).

Also part of your brain does not know what to do else - make dedicated times when you allow yourself to check or to have dedicated milestones. Once I clean the dishes I can check. 

And last, think about your plan. Is part of your mind not decided yet on the fact that you need to rebuy the dip? Then your brain will trigger you to check over and over again.

Do you need to sell? Set limit orders and go away. 

Do you want to buy? set limit orders and go away.

hth Start the day by writing the 3 most important things you have to do today. Then add to the list some other stuff you can do on bonus.
Do thoses 3 important things first thing without interruption no phone email whatsoever.
Then give yourself some slack and see to do the rest or part of it.
Repeat the next day.

Result = more productivity + important stuff done first + less distraction / price checking the only strategy, to keep buying btc! 4life dont need to remove apps or websites look at btc prices everyday and train your mental mind! Update: phone out of arms reach (like 100ft away) while working today has been great. I'll get into my groove and not even think about where the phone is. I also like that I removed all apps that can show me the price. Gonna keep this up for the rest of the week and see how I feel then. 

Thanks for the input all. 

Also, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rank this habit a 5. So it's not crippling or anything. But I don't like using my time in habitual ways that harm my productivity or ability to be present in the moment during free time. I feel for those out there that have lost control of this very controllable habit."
55;Bitcoin is officially a new asset class: Goldman Sachs;njw171;3484;1621856695.0;Georgelynch1986;;89;"Pretty funny when you think about the timing of this release.

I wonder who got in on the dip.  Seems to be all this positive news all of a sudden bitcoin is here to stay qnd good long term investment.  Last week the cypto world was finished.  Lol Gee, what great timing. Who could've predicted that this weekend's fud was clearing a lower price for large institutions to get in? ü§î Of course it is now that it is/was on sale.
I cant knock them though, I had no choice but to buy bitcoin to convert my lower asset positions over to BTC as well‚Ä¶ These guys can go fuck themselves guess who bought the dip? I always try to find the source report but in this case I only found [this](https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1395884451549356037?s=21) Twitter thread that appears to be some sort of comprehensive report by GS on Crypto. Always has been, this is just an opinion piece recognising that Bitcoin is a thing. I believe in BTC. But I don‚Äôt think an institution gets to decide what is an asset or not. I‚Äôll keep buying. Wha? Goldman Sachs gets to decide what is an asset class and what isn't?

Wouldn't it be the task of lawmakers and courts to elaborate on how crypto is treatet in the books of a company or private person? Oh yeah NOW it's an asset class, eh? Did someone press the Hopium button and release all these good news all of a sudden? They're trying to play people like a fiddle. Goldman Sachs is now officially a new asset class: Bitcoin Remember. By fudding the price down to 30k, from 60k they managed to secure 2x profits. Just like that. Whatever price they may sell now or if they plan to hodl they now have 2x the coins ""I've never heard of this Goldman Sachs entity, nor am I particularly interested in what, if anything, it is aware of. All are welcome to transact bitcoin."" - Bitcoin CEO When the manipulators do a 180 like this, it means they have bought the bottom and can't lower the price anymore and are ready to raise it, if we see more like them reverse their public statements in favor of Bitcoin it will be a further indicator of the manipulation coordination. They bought the dip. Breaking news: rich people have decided Bitcoin has value Wow it's no nice of the super wealthy elite to finally tell us what we already knew. Get fucked assholes. Okay we are done buying - GS These fucking ppl are so predictable is not even funny. I didn‚Äôt sell absolutely anything. They took profit at the ATH, tanked it, bought it, and now they are pumping it again. I said to myself. If after this I‚Äôm left with $1K out of the $60k I have invested I‚Äôm prepared to wait 10 years but I‚Äôm not falling for this. These fuckheads keep manipulating the market by controlling the news. Never trust any financial news at face value. GS: So we brought the dip, let's raise the price to make profit now. they put out a bunch of crypto shit the last few days, from the ""centralization problem"" of mining to this. it's all over the place. Keep paying attention to the crypto news in mainstream journalism and you‚Äôll get rekt... Bitcoin specifically, not crypto in general. ""clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class"" - it doesn't sound like Goldman Sachs says its officially a new asset class. Sure they say it's an investable asset, but that has been true for over 10 years and is very obvious. You can invest in anything if someone is willing to sell it to you. I don‚Äôt care what the suits say about Bitcoin. Goldman Sachs, the Guy, just like Central Banks, etc....
We don't need them ( we are better off without them) and Bitcoin DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.... About time, the technology gap is so wiiiiiiddddddeeeeeeeeee. Clearly. Just confirming that all the paper hands will regret their weakness for selling the bottom on the most obvious coordinated FUD attack ever. It‚Äôs almost like they shit talked it for years.  Then got quiet.  Let a kookoo billionaire hype the shit  out of it.  Ask politely for the kookoo man to pull the rug.  And then position themselves at that real safe 30k floor. Now it‚Äôs ok to like it. 

My investment app had the most bullish crypto article I‚Äôd ever seen this morning.

Institutions are in. The game has changed.   The tactic is still HOLD. Officially?  Fuck u, slow ass losers Goldman Stacks Sats Fucking latecomers. We know already. ok i'm gonna say it .who cares about some limp dick dangling  Sachs  . if you need a confirmation from those fucks ... you probably  have a fetish of being  a dog on a leash . This is old news, its was officially an asset class in 2009.  Just took Goldman this long to figure it out.  Happy to have them on board. Goldman Sachs can sachs my big black dickz. They still don't realize that Bitcoin has become the effective unit of account check this out from 2020, not long ago they were against it.

another example why you don't listen to the bankers. ""officially""

Since when does bitcoin care about officials... All the yahoo finance posting on this sub is hella lame This doesn't smell right. I am holding. Goldman Sachs are the biggest legal Con artist there are First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then they hoard Funny that. Bitcoin was dead last week? Now that there's a discount its suddenly the best thing since sliced bread. - We bitcoiners can see right through this shit. So it isn‚Äôt dead, Again? Finally we have the Boomer's approval.

\*intense chanting\* Fuck them and other big money for orchestrating this shit. 

Like pigs at a trough, except pigs stop when they‚Äôre full. 1m here we come :) Goldman sucks. Bitcoin laughs. It‚Äôs still in a dip. Anything under 40k is a massive dip. I just bought more and will keep buying more. It didn‚Äôt take goldman sucks for me to realize this ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Like it or not this is actual history. In the future we‚Äôll look back on the first time Bitcoin was deemed as a new asset class by one of the largest financial firms in US history.

Edit: grammar Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs' global head of digital assets, has a conflict of interest: keeping his job. i find it ironic that we need goldman sachs to tell us that, given that they literally represent everything that's corrupt about the financial system. 

i don't know what satoshi thinks, but i doubt he/she's going to say: ""good job guys, goldman sachs officially recognizes BTC as a new asset class, great work!"" that'd be highly ironic. Is this the death knell for Bitcoin? These bastards again? why even waste a second on them? Well come to the party üéâ Great news! He said their clients see Bitcoin as a new asset class. Not that they think it is. If I got it correct. It‚Äôs not like Goldman Sachs is some kind of deciding factor when something is an asset or not. So does this mean buy nowüëÄ I'm pretty sure they have been onboard for quite a while, while at the same time talking trash about crypto in general.. Robert Kiyosaki constantly pumps Bitcoin and gold and his show is sponsored by Goldman Sachs. :-/ Thank god i believed in my own researchüí™üèº
Fook these whales! Let‚Äôs wait 5 years Wonder how long it will take for them to become shitcoiners. Bitcoin going to dump again So has Bitcoin become ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù? Oy vey! Bitcoin was better off when the banks and behemoth AUM firms didn‚Äôt care for it. Expect even more manipulation now. You‚Äôll learn to trade it or be frustrated from its lack of continued past growth by hodling. Those options will take it where big money directs it now. All without any reasoning behind its price movement. Let me guess, they bought the dip. Some may think,this block chain technology can bring us some kind of Terminator but Truth is he could travel on time ,future to past belive me he could he didn't  if he played our DNA I don't know but let's think cleaver,
May option crypto markets are all positive that means it's a good sign but I couldn't buy because I had no money.
Who ever bought before I'm sure they are happy. Fuck you Goldman. We hate you. fuck elon musk and fuck the chinese government Well duh The report was made on Friday and there were dips over the weekend. Now we have a new headline by Yahoo and everyone's bullish. Funny how all of these institutions try to scare all of the little guys out to cause a dip and then buy it up and call it legitimate. Look at the market trends for gold around the 1970's when the Fed was trying to do the same thing to keep people invested into their worthless pieces of paper Goldman needed only 10 years to figure that out? I am relieved, the banking system has a prosperous future. /s The sky is officially blue bc I say it is. Bitcoin has never needed old Wall Streets permission.
It was the day it was invented. FUCK YOU GOLDMAN NUTSACKS Their internal documents also forecast the Flippening as ""highly likely."" One guess as to what the next ""new asset"" will be... bitcoin was an asset class before anyone made it official, whatever the fuck that even means. itt: people pretending that ‚Äúpublic exchange prices‚Äù are what institutions buy at They are adding it as a new class so that it will open up shorting. Once shorting is possible.. Wonder what happens I felt bad about buying GS stock a couple of weeks ago since they've done so many bad things, but this makes me feel better.  Thanks for posting that.

62;If Bitcoin is an accepted World Currency;nl7oq9;6;1622001093.0;AbsolutStorm;"I‚Äòm at the beginning of learning Bitcoin and have a question.
Imagine, Bitcoin is an accepted world currency and is growing like now (about 150% a year).
How would it be possible to buy things in shops with BTC or sats, when the Bitcoin is growing so fast.
Every product will be more and more expensive, or do I have a mistake in my mind?";8;"Layer 2. 

By the time it happens, pricing will not occur in dollars in the first palce. If we had to buy stuff in, say. Mexican Pesos bit had to convery from Euro subject to the constant fluctuations one to the other, one migjt conclude neither is stable enough to be used as a currency. But we don't notice,caise things are,priced,i, the local currency.

Short answer: when it happens, stuff will be prices in Sats and most transactions will occur over layer 2 almost for free.

Here, round out,your education. The Bitcoin Standard, audio book.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0rIQJYWOqMs&t=23157s Technology naturally drives the price of goods down.  Inflation and the current monetary policy drives prices up.  We are now reaching a point where inflation cannot keep up with the exponential growth of technology.  The current system is in a death spiral.

On a Bitcoin Standard goods will become cheaper because of technology.  The amount of Bitcoin something costs will go down naturally and the net result is humans will have more time to do what we want.

The is really hard for most to grasp because it is almost the complete opposite of the current system and how we are trained to think an economy works.

Edit: wording Bitcoin probably won't be used for everyday transactions any time soon.  Better to think of it now as digital gold Soon the .99 cent stores will be replaced with .99 Bitcoin stores. If and when Bitcoin reaches world reserve status, it will no longer be rapidly appreciating in value. It will become fairly stable. Bitcoin has massive gains now, but the gains have been lessening over time. And this will continue to happen as it grows. If it becomes that. That‚Äôs when 1Btc=1M+ Bitcoin cannot come close to handling the transaction volume of a world currency government wont ackknowledge without being able to control it"

Can someone explain why there is a gambling ad every 5 seconds on UK television ? Every time I stream a soccer match that's like every single commercial... Bet365 or some shit. It was due to 3 complaints - Probably the CEO's of Lloyds, HSBC and Barclays. Nanny state UK. Oi, you got a loicence to post that advert? LOL .gov do stupid stuff Id advise you to re-read the ad. No where does it say to buy ""CRYPTO"" *it‚Äôs bloody Bitcorn you nob. DYOR or get rekt. Eh, it's not like you would be allowed an ad saying it's time to buy a certain stock either. This is just strict advertising regulations in the UK, nothing to do with crypto specifically. But, it is the right time. Is it ironic that they won't let me read the article because of my ad blocker? They love rules in the UK. I'm sure the guy who made it thanked them politely when he was handed a fine.

67;A very good summary by Michael Saylor, incl. his chats with Musk (who is more sane than he likes to pretend);nltl90;74;1622069210.0;JanPB;"It's at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibCXhvf4IAg) link. A quote:

""I think it became pretty clear that we, the Bitcoiners, have a good story, but it's a very complicated story. And we need to find a way to share our story and to educate [...] My first thought was there is no point in us tweeting back and forth at each other because I don't think a 288-character twitters are right ways to educate the public and build consensus. 

""So I reached out to Elon and I spoke with him and we had a very long conversation and [...] I asked him if he had relationship or had met with Bitcoin miners [...] Elon [...] said we would all benefit if we were able to publish energy usage and sources of energy usage data. It turns out that Bitcoin miners don't actually have a good form for communicating how they generate their energy. We don't have a shared common model for energy usage right now. [...] 

""I asked Elon if he had relationships with the miners and he said he'd like to meet them, so I reached out to the miners and I asked them if they'd like to meet Elon Musk, and they said yes, they would. And so we set up a meeting because he wanted to understand how they are mining and what their plans and futures are, and they wanted to understand his concerns, and we wanted to understand how we could be the good guys inthe entire ESG debate [...]

""And so I think that the group came together to get Elon's thoughts and for us to brainstorm on what we can do in order to communicate constructively to the entire industry and avoiding reinventing the wheel, right?""";17;"‚ÄúAnd so I think that the group came together to get Elon‚Äôs thoughts‚Äù

Maybe I‚Äôm missing something but.... Why!?!?! Why the fuck does this immature prick matter at all!  I try to put myself in the miners shoes but why tf do they care? Is it to get funding? I definitely am happy that energy usage seems to be getting constructively tackled, but what the actual fuck. I‚Äôm so tired of Elon holy shit If green bitcoin is going to become the narrative of the next few years I think it‚Äôs a good time to buy some stock in BitFarms. Not financial advice. >I don't think a 288-character twitters are right ways to educate the public and build **consensus.**

consensus doesn't happen behind closed doors with only corporations participating Imagine the tension in the room. I‚Äôm done with both of these bozos. Saylor thinks he‚Äôs Bitcoin Jesus and Elon needs to stay in his lane making stupid looking EVs. Dude doesn‚Äôt know the difference between a shitcoin and bitcoin. Ugh. Fuck Elon Musk. He's an evil capitalist overlord. I think that Michalel recognized correctly, that he cannot fight Elon so he must play to his ego to make him feel important so he will STFU. Sounds reasonable. I'm glad Micheal is checking on Elon, it's in everyone's interest (for now at least ! ) Saylor is a man of action. Huge fucking respect to him for getting Elon to interface with the miners. Elon may publicly display some immature personality traits, but he has extreme vision, truly cares about the earth and the future of humanity and he can make things happen on a scale that defies most people‚Äôs comprehension. Great good will come from these connections Saylor facilitated. Imagine all Bitcoin mining being powered by sustainable energy. If you think freedom comes from decentralized economic power, ask yourself what that truly means when you can‚Äôt even read this post on your computer or phone without participating in the collective underwriting of a system that destroys the future our planet in exchange for an immediate short term supply of electricity. Saylor comes across as an even more self righteous jackass than Elon. Both of them are brilliant in their field but should stay out of crypto as their sucking up all the oxygen in the room. Elon just stole all the miners secrets Hero worship A danger here is we lose the fungibility of bitcoin and we end up with ‚Äúdirty bitcoin‚Äù and ‚Äúgreen/clean bitcoin‚Äù. 
That gives an in for the rich to start vacuuming up the clean, potentially more valuable, bitcoin and leaving us hodlers with our dirty stuff I feel bad that elon got that much of btc , and throw some useless fiat in the face of poor people ,    but  I feel good for Michael Saylor tho üòÅ \#elon-dont-deserve-it    .          guys let him know , let him dump it all and leave us alone 1) Fuck Musk

Blockfi is backed by major players in crypto space like CoinBase and Winkle Twins and other giant investors. They are also the first credit card to offer rewards in bitcoin.

Fyi, I have zero ties with Blockfi. I just do my own research. I have about 5% of my bag In blockfi.  I am happy with their service and the rest of my bag is in cold storage.   Started with them around the 8k level and plan on using their credit card.  Using facial recognition to withdraw is kinda wierd but not a deal breaker for me at this point, since I didnt know this was a thing until I had already deposited.  Making more than a million sats this year has been pretty satisfying. Not going to have the Cold Wallet vs DeFi vs CeFi debate, but if you do choose to use CeFi the best option is Celsius Network. I've never had a problem with my blockfi since November of last year. 
They made a mistake, owned up to it. It's to bad that some people won't do the right thing and pay it back. If this was a bank, you would have the sheriff knocking on your door. Adjustable rate interest rates are ALWAYS a scam.

Dollar cost averaging :) How long are you planning to hold? buy and wait. number go up I‚Äôm on the same boat as you, bought 0.1 a couple days ago and I‚Äôll buy more when my salary comes and then I went ahead and bought Ledger Nano X , if I were you I‚Äôd buy it now since they need 3 weeks to deliver it Blah blah blah. Just buy, OP. In the time you‚Äôre taking to think it over, the price can skyrocket. Don‚Äôt take our word for it but if you‚Äôre jumping on, jump on. Buy low, sell high.

*You'll thank me later...* yes we shaved off like 6 months of investments, I bought at 40k CAD ish.

either that or you can take a risk and wait for another potential dip,.if it doesn't dip you may lose your chance to get cheap bitcoin.

if it dips you win some cheap bitcoin by waiting, either way the long term is looking BULLISH. it comes down to how much discount you want on your bitcoin and how long term you are holding. HODL You've got to have your wits about you.  99% of everything on reddit/tweeter/youtube/msm(big pharma)/wall street(big pharma) is stupid bullshit and retarded memes.  Most of these idiot's livelihood's depend on the status quo, i.e. wall street and fiat. Bitcoin isn't really an investment. It's more similar to playing poker. You're going to win and lose if you only hold, but if you sell at the top and buy at the bottom you will continually win."

95;Banks Pollute Way More Than Bitcoin, Study Finds;nl7oy7;210;1622001115.0;PeacockMamba;;13;"Im pro Bitcoin, only this article does say something else. This article is about how polluted the investments are not how polluted the system is. Banks fulfill more roles than bitcoin does. Of course they do Bitcoin would still be worth it if it were powered by dirty coal.  Come up with a reliable climate model before you start shutting down industries through government force and violence. Thought this was common sense >But considering that CO2 emissions from the Bitcoin blockchain are estimated to be around 57 million metric tons, it might be a good idea for Tesla to stop receiving US dollar (which is over 10X more pollutive) if the environmental concerns are indeed enough to change one of Tesla‚Äôs accepted payment methods

What a bad take, the way PoW works, if BTC was used by as many people as USD, the price would be so high that miners would be using magnitudes more energy. Every dollar the price goes up is another 900$ per day of electricity spend that the network incentivizes. Its fk true. 

I bet you anything a simple analyses would prove people's domestic pets, their dogs and cats, produce more CO2 than bitcoin mining, given that each one's carbon print is larger than an SUV over each of their lifetimes.

There is 1 single volcano in Iceland kicking out more co2 per year than bitcoin, and has been doing so for a millenia. I suppose the last ice age ended because of cars? Bitcoin? Nope. 

Maybe LiddleElon can sell his ShitCoin carbon credits to the volcano. He should fly ther on his private jet and leap into it for negotiations. And that volcano, kicking out gigatons of co2 over millenia, is fueled by magma giving Iceland all of its ""green"" geothermal energy. But if you think about it, the volcano is just a big-A$$ smokestack of a power plant with ""green geo thermal energy"" on the other side of it. Tons of co2, gobs of sulfur to make acid rain. Its the worst the haters hate about high sulfur coal fired power plants.

I'm so fk sick of arguing on Captain Planet's terms. Because Ted Turner is an asshole and his propaganda was like mother's milk to baby Musky, turning,him into a fk psycho. Since when did the carbon cycle (product of intelligent design) become a bad thing? Plants grow faster with more Co2. So what? Old textbooks used to say that before guys like Musky filled them with lies.

Nodody wants smog. Me neither. Most of the smog in LA Valley is comprised of suspended paint fumes.The western word has the best, cleanest energy. Even our coal plants kick out low everything except co2. Luckily, c02 causes higer crop yeilds. Probably explains why Iceland us so green among other things.

Communists and dictators pollute the most. Musky should fly on his private jet to North Korea and demand little Kimmy fix his industry. He should then shout down the peasants for consuming what,little power they get. He should swing by China and lecture Pingy about being a better steward.

But bitcoin heralds freedom for the world. Wars are fought over dilluted currency. Arguably, every society that has failed throughout history has done so ast the result of the dillution of money. Hard money would have prevented that. (Source: The bitcoun Standard book https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0rIQJYWOqMs&t=23157s )

But people think that all world wars of the 20th century, and throughout history, are less important than bankrupting everyone to tax the product of life itself. It is simply immoral, and evil. Worshiping false gods kills millions. Maybe billioms. If hard money can prevent world war 3, they would still take it away because bitcoin causes as much co2 emission as a single volcano in Iceland?

Yes. Becaise it is not about CO2. It is about slavemasters seeking whipped slaves to thank them for their chains. When the slavemasters dillute the money they steal the collective time and energy of everyone. Suddenly the products of citizens life's work, the sacrafice of their youth on the alter of tine to make a living, and living beneath their means to store up something to leave their kids is stolen. 

Forgive the sermon. 
Prv 13:22:¬†A good man leaves an inheritance to his children‚Äôs children.

Though this doesn't indicate money persay, but rather, good character, I'd argue that without hard money, the good habits leading to wealth creation cannot be demonstrated. We can teach our kids to spend everythign they make becuse it will buy less tomorrow. Thats the lesson of all Venezuelans. What else can there be? For Americans it's, 'take out huge debts, because the value of the debt decreases over time.' And many other bad lessons...

Thus the wealth that should have passed between generations to allow children to live better lives also is stolen, and they, too, are enslaved by debt and the dillutors of money.

Fk that. Fk captain planet. And fk Obama who, after swearing the ocean levels were rising, bought a 14 million beachfront mansion today worth close to 100.

Electricity is pollution when not produced properly.  
   
Like if it was not a problem before Bitcoin... This whataboutism was never a good narrative.

It uses entirely different energy makeup. Absolutely, they keep printing more papers. Bitcoin uses energy to mine . I get that but doesn't TESLA take electricity to produce and charge their vehicles. what about the disposal of the battery's on the environment ?  These are questions that Elon should answer. Also instead of putting money going to Mars and the Moon why don't he use his money to research and build energy efficient  charging stations. I go to the convenience store and the TELSA charging stations are powered by coal fired power.

98;To those that yell ‚Äòwinter is coming‚Äô;nl4qqm;8;1621991124.0;tangerineandteal;"Genuine question. I‚Äôve seen lots of comments during the dip/crash which were variants of ‚Äòwinter is coming‚Äô or ‚Äòcrash is here‚Äô.

Now that we are green, these comments have faded away. 

It scares me when dissenting voices disappear and we are in what sounds like an echo chamber. 

Im quite bullish myself. As a 2017 Hodler, I‚Äôve made gains simply by holding long term. I avoided any losses last week by holding, even as I saw my profits drip down to 40% of their April value. 

For me, not responding to the short/mid term dips has been the best approach, consistently for the past 4years. It‚Äôs groin grabbingly painful when the market is red, but the hodl is only way for me. 

So my question to the bears is genuine: are there tangible factors which caused you to be so bearish and which of these factors are still in play? Has your opinion change in the last week? What are the main basis of your thinking?";5;"They have zero data or evidence to back it up. They‚Äôre simply gay bears that shorted trying to spread fud. Winter came and it was a damn disappointment I am not a bear, but in order to help put an end to the FUD that the bull run is somehow over or that Bitcoin is crashing to zero, have a look at this chart....it overlays the 2017 run with the current one we‚Äôre in, normalized to simply show the percentage change versus how many days post-halving we are at. https://mobile.twitter.com/PrestonPysh/status/1397213421431631877

Best words of advice I keep coming back to when dealing with the fear after a price crash is simply....‚ÄùZOOM OUT!!!‚Äù I think we are still ‚Äúin the winter‚Äù this week.  Reassess this coming weekend / next week. Bearish sentiment for me is how profitable mining is at the moment.

I have PTSD from 2018-2019 and I am feeling a bit like in the matrix when Neo see a black cat twice.

To me we are post ATH of this cycle and in a period akin to March-July of 2018 were we oscillate widely between bear and bull but below ATH but still above profitable territory for miners. This with a alt summer and lowering Bitcoin dominance. We are missing a catalyst event such as the War between the two forks of the bitcoin Judas. That catalyst event will bring us in full bear territory and it‚Äôll be Alt winter and Bitcoin dominance will come back up. But Fiat will leave both Bitcoin and Alts. Miners will shutdown and only the most profitable miners with the cheapest electricity will remain. Difficulty will retrace down as many miners drop of the network.

I have the feeling like this can happen all over again with the green washing and the way Saylor and Musk are trying to appropriate Bitcoin to their own agenda.

If we get into trouble to fight for consensus on a greener Bitcoin through sponsorship of Saylor to the Bitcoin devs, centralized effort and collusion of miners, ESG investment influence on Institution having Bitcoin on their balance sheet, it‚Äôll end up in blood. To me Saylor and Elon are up to no good, I feel in in my soul.

So yeah, I‚Äôm a bear at the moment and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling we are going to visit 20-25k ‚Ç¨ within 12 months. Maybe even 16-17k‚Ç¨ and that‚Äôll be dangerously close to previous ATH and such a thing hasn‚Äôt happened in the past so even a bear like me don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible but it‚Äôs the current break even rate at which I‚Äôm currently mining without taking into account amortization of the rig.

A bear cycle will be good for Bitcoin because people thinking for the greater good of bitcoin are silenced when the masses are shutting up because they are in the green and making money hand over first and bad actors have an avenue to make Bitcoin worse.

Even at the current price they is I think a good chance to be a bag holder for another 4 years if it crashes to 16-25k."

 bitcoin has 21 million max ever...

just because bitcoin ""costs"" more doesn't mean its not the better investment, it probably still is. That‚Äôs all of our dreams and my regret...wish I would‚Äôve listened to my weird cousin in 2013 who told me to buy 5 Bitcoin.. Bought millions at one dollar, means now owning ~ $ 50 billion.

If so and still hodling they won't be here anymore would be my guess........

But the Winkelvoss Brothers have done pretty much just that.. No. I don't think anyone other than satoshi has ever controlled more than 1m BTC. Not even mtgox got quite that high. Some early miners got into the low hundreds of thousands."

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* You can‚Äôt destroy what you can‚Äôt catch. That‚Äôs the whole point of decentralisation üëåüèªüíé ‚ÄúWhat does ‚Äúintrinsic value‚Äù mean?‚Äù. 
It means ownership of the asset generates some sort of tangible benefit - you can live in a house or rent it out, shares generate dividends, i can charge people to view a Picasso etc.

Your arguments conflate two issues. 1) can anyone ever ‚Äòstop‚Äô the trade of BTC? No - its too decentralised. But the more important issue is 2) what is the long-term value of BTC? And that is where lack of intrinsic value becomes important. BTC is the ""gateway"" crypto - it's the most famous, but once you get set up with a multi currency wallet, you realise that they all basically do the same thing, and you don't need to worry about ""the price of Bitcoin"" and FOMO, because there are plenty of others that you can use to send $100 to your mate overseas.

The ""only 21 million"" argument that people use to justify the massive prices isn't valid because people can just choose something else. You're not going to be left without purchasing power by not owning BTC - you can just buy something else and use it as a transfer mechanism - there's no good rational incentive to HODL it. People buying at these stupidly high prices, investing millions or billions don't yet realise that there's no reason why everyone MUST use BTC to transact. In fact, just as people were trying to give the middle finger to banks by starting up the BTC network, we can just as easily give the middle finger to BTC and boycott it - we have thousands of options, and we are nowhere near mass adoption. People can effectively ""cancel"" the value of these big investments by voting with our wallets and refusing to participate out of principle. We're not going to be locked out of crypto if we don't own BTC, and I expect the ""smart money"" big investors won't stick around for as long as you might think - they'll use it to extract profits from the FOMO people who buy it after them, then dump for USD again. There's very little purchasing power with BTC while it relies on being converted to fiat to spend for real goods. It's simply a wealth transfer at this point, and if you HODL for too long, it's YOUR wealth being transferred.

My advice - admire crypto, get used to how it works, but don't get hung up on HODLers telling you that only BTC will succeed. The arguments in the linked article work just as well if you replace the word ""Bitcoin"" with any one of its clones. Bitcoin (or any crypto, or money supply) works a lot better for everyone if you don't hoard it.

What started as a trustless decentralized payment system has morphed into a massive speculation based on an argument that is no longer valid (only 21 million). Just as we can print more money, we can create new chains, and they still have the same attributes, some even better (ie, better privacy).

Don't believe the hype. It's just software and mathematics, not a religion or a prophecy. Nice"

Sure, why else put powerful GPU's in the cars that arent used throughout most of the day (Until automated tesla taxi service become available in the future) car battery + grid + crypto Damn... This is a brilliant prediction. He could mine it using their solar panels and batteries so it would be 100% renewable. ""Elon will invent mining later this year"" As in Solar City?  Frankly that would be smart albeit we need solar to initially power the grid ...not crowd out with bitcoin mining.  Elon‚Äôs carbon saving Tesla cars are still powered almost entirely via our existing power grid which is essentially carbon based. Mining module for Tesla power wall. I really do not believe Elon is good for crypto. The man has his ambitions and is it‚Äôs clear after the past few pumps he has manipulated the market for his own gain. Anyone who truly believes he is in it for us has been truly fooled Didn't think it would be Tesla to do it but been calling for this technical integration since about 2016 ish. 

Its a great concept of using mining to create a natural load balancer for a battery. The issue is with such a big player being first to the races with this is a likely reduction of freedoms for the user. If they implement it right it would be awesome though.. We don't want to force users to specific pools as an example. I feel like this is the equivalent of betting that the sun will rise tomorrow morning. I wouldn't be surprised if all of the teslas ever made received an update that uses them to mine You're lacking detail in this prediction.

fuk musk Tesla has bought bitcoin again at price 34k$. Elon musk didn't say anything about it LUL...Why bet your bitcoin?  Everybody wants your bitcoin including musk boy.  He's a government tool so you will likely lose your coin LUL!!! Who gives a shit what he does, he's just playing all you retail noobs with his retarded stoner tweets. He's already proved he's micro-intellect with regards to crypto. You'd be better of ignoring him and focusing on the fundamentals. 

He may be a big player in fiat, but his holdings are dwarfed by many already on this space and he can't do much of anything to affect the the long term trajectory. You know what... that might be a good idea for him. He can start with using solar .... probably need a solar field size of Nevada but... who knows. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all. Y u nutride Elon tho. Yaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwnnnnnn I'll bet you a stanley nickel. #fuckelon its quite possibly. with the green energy approach he may try to get fossil miners out of the game... too bad BTC is not a democratic system and they can mine whenever and however they want Very dangerous. Just what we need, another shithead launching another shitcoin! he will dump all the btc they have and make a big deal about it I think he'll sell Some SolarCity stuff to miners instead. Musk gets his pound of flesh... use my solar panels (green energy) or I will stomp you out... 

Like it or not his tweets move the market. He'll call it Minor Mining. Elon musk might be thinking of a partnership with ARGO I mean solar power would be much more efficient on the moon. So build solar power plants on the moon to mine bitcoin. Light delay is about 1.25 seconds,  so not enough to cause significantly increased orphaned blocks. Yes we can expect that from him.

1) He completely collapses the price with fud

2) Destroy his image enough that nobody will believe he will create a Tesla miner. two types of corporations: those who mine crypto and those who don't admit If anything I think he will open his own mining company/pool. It's a simple endeavor compared to Space X, Tesla, Neuralink. He should give up on selling cars. It‚Äôs not going too well Of course. Why else crash the price of bitcoin so miners stop buying new GPU‚Äôs. Or he starts selling ‚Äúimproved‚Äù solar panels for the purposes of BTC mining. He already has a solar panel division and makes money off carbon credits. It's a natural fit, energy and Tesla... mining fits right in. It's good until he decides he'll be mining EBTC, the new and improved consensus rules that add much needed inflation, larger blocks, faster blocks, and requires an Alon-permit to mine. Fuck him. Who cares? you can bet elon will accept bitcoin again Bitcoin mining in combination with the solar roof would actually be a good idea. Mine coins whenever there is more energy than needed, which would also amortize the costs more quickly. Why don't we start our own shill space program with our BTC? That‚Äôs a fair assessment & assumption. But you know what‚Äôs missing with crypto in general? Stable exchanges and real life uses. We are imagining the uses and investing for the future. For companies like Tesla, a shareholder should be able to conceive and realize potential in a very short term too. 

We are so early that it‚Äôs exciting and nerve wrecking in the same breath. Stick a miner in each power wall/solar roof, use any curtailed energy to mine.

You fat bastards are gonna love being poor. Power to the people! ""Ah, the conspiracy subs would eat this up"" something I got told when bringing up something similar to this on this exact sub. People in here are straight incels. People gotta remember that Elon‚Äôs inner circle has been into Crypto since 2016. He knows what‚Äôs going on and where it‚Äôs heading. I‚Äôve been saying this‚Ä¶ 100 percent agree!!! üíéüíéüíé And the new Tesla‚Äôs will be mining TesCoin while in overdrive mode.

Trying to make it drop to announce heavy involvement and investment and ride it all the way up. he should repurpose the boring company lol That fool musk never talked to any miners, he‚Äôs a scammer creating a hustle I had the same thoughts back when he discuss impact to environment.

Makes perfect sense.  Perhaps he offers Solar farm and datacenter for miners to use. What if they let your car mine crypto while its not being used and connected to your solar home. Who‚Äôs this clown op posting this. Btc doesn‚Äôt need Elon. Elon needs btc. The fact that Elon even got into btc n didn‚Äôt do any dd or research is just showing how much of a clown he is and people like the op that posted this really put him on a high pedestal when he isn‚Äôt at all impressive. He‚Äôs basically the Steve Jobs. Good salesman but couldn‚Äôt code or anything yet the media and ignorant people put him as a brilliant computerist. Just like Elon n his fanboys ü§£üòÇü§°ü§°üëèüèªüëèüèª I thought the memo said no more Elon discussions. Elon has exposure to renewable energy via Solar City too.

103;How I Lost All My Bitcoin Assets at 31K Due to a Dumb Mistake in Margin Trading;nm5tjs;0;1622116795.0;sirchugh;;2;"
TL/DR: Auteur made a wrong bet (shorting BTC) and got liquidated. Auteur got liquidated because he had insufficient collateral to maintain his position. 

My view:
The issue with new people margin trading is that they do not use the stop-loss function. The author describes other issues that reduced his collateral but that only increased the severity. Dummy bet his whole stack, without a stop loss. Practiced 0 risk management.

Good risk management exposes your trading account to losses to less than ~ 5%.

Decent strategy is to only bet a portion of your trading account.(plan for the worst scenario, in which your whole bet is lost, to uncontrolled scenarios like system outages, or volatility spikes)

Couple this with reasonable stop losses(the trick is to use just enough leverage to give your idea some room to breathe by not having a stop loss too close to the action, escaping the volatility)

Good example is 10% bet size, with a 10-50% stop loss.

This will leave u at a 1-5%+fees loss, and 10% loss if liquidated.

This would be practicing decent risk management methods with 2 layers of protection, bet size + stop loss.

Lastly have exit targets in mind, (don't get on a bus when you don't know where to get off)

If you can manage risk this way, you can create bets that are essentially binary coin flips.

One side of the coin is ~1-5% loss / other side is 3-15% gains 

3-5 times your potential losses as gains, this range should be your ideas success rate, but the goal is to have 1 win pay for x losses

So your wins can make up for 3-5 losses in a row.

But as they are binary bets the law of averages is 50% win rate.

Didn't mean for this to be longwinded but it is more important to practice good risk management then it is to have good trade ideas. Hope this helps someone."

Im just learning about BTC, and i think higher hashrate means more security. So with the halving through the years + the compute power increasing, maybe the reward shared by the miners won't be able to encourage the miners to continue to maintain the network at a secure hashrate by the time, due to the price of bitcoin ""not following"" the way less BTC each miner receive.

I do have a interest in bitcoin but atm I feel like I'm not ready but I still don't understand how to buy bitcoin. Honestly I'm just wanna buy ¬£200 pound worth of bitcoin so I can buy cali weed to smoke cuz my dealer only uses bitcoin for payment and now I'm going around everywhere wondering how bitcoin works.;9;"1.find an exchange thats reputable and you like.

2. decide a payment option e-transfers or credit card or w/e

3. use those funds to buy bitcoin on the exchange.

4. thats the smartest weed dealer ever To obtain Bitcoin, some people create an account with Coinbase or some such on-line ""exchange"".  They'll want to know your bank account, your social security number, ... a photo of your photo ID, the names of your friends in the 3rd grade, a short movie of you sticking a dead bat down your pants... Etc.  This bullshit is the fault of the cowards who run our government and banking system (turns out they've made a lot of really serious enemies, all over the world, for the last several decades..)

Anyhow, that all takes time... It could take weeks.  So, if you think you'll go that way don't wait until the last minute.  

Other people use cash app.  I don't know much about that.  

Some lucky people buy Bitcoin from one of their friends. Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO.
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey. Consider saving a chunk of the bitcoin you purchase whenever you buy more weed lol. Seems like an ill-conceived idea on the part of your dealer - if his addresses are ever linked to him that will be a pretty direct line of evidence between you two. If either of you created your wallets within the last few years, chances are your gov can find out what you've been up to in the crypto space. He is probably doing that because he thinks it is cool and doesn't realize he has created a job of laundering his cash where previously this was not something he had to worry about. Now he is at risk of broadcasting his activities. 

Cash is the much safer option assuming you don't want anyone to know about your purchase (your government, presumably)

I personally only use exchanges like Coinbase Pro and Voyager for btc. However since you are using this for illegal activities (which I have no issue with) I'd suggest you tell your dealer they can easily buy btc with cold untraceable cash. If you get a chance find out what wallet/exchange they use and do some research regarding reporting requirements for tax purposes. In the US know-your-customer laws mean pretty much any exchange you use will report your activity for tax purposes. 

I know if a dealer who thought using venmo was a great way to make the biz easier. Got hit with the tax bill 8 months later Try also r/bitcoinbeginners. Coinbase takes 30 minutes to start trading. Same with Robinhood. Unless your going to get serious and cold store then use one of these. Step 1: Open an account on Coinbase or Binance, Kraken..

Step  2: Deposit said 200 onto exchange.

Step 3: Exchange $$$ for Bitcoin.

Step 4: Completely forget about said Bitcoin during your next spliff induced haze.

Step 5: Spend the next 10 years going about your life, working long hours, taking it from ""the man"".  Get married maybe even start a family and settle down.

Step 6: Wake up one day and realise you forgot all about that weed acc that is now worth $2.1mil.  You're rich!!!  Consider yourself a Bitcoin OG....  You've finally made it.

Step 7: Spend the next 4 years trying to guess the password that you forgot to write down all those years ago.

Step 8: Spend the next 20 years telling your kids that ""Dad was once a millionaire.  Stay in school. Don't smoke your life away.. ""... If you use bitcoin for illegal activities you will most likely get caught"

In the 21st Century, we will separate money and state. Glad to see a little fun back in this thread.  Common corn!

First they sell via Wyckoff, then all the FUD to dump the price, then they load up and suddenly all these good news coming out. In my professional Heineken based opinion we need to hold $37987.23 as support. If not going back to Coors Light. Might take a couple days to heat up. Lots of people are a little exhausted, waiting to see if it may dip again, or waiting on the sidelines to get back in. A couple days of relative stability (which we are getting right now) should instil a lot of confidence in new investors, and the people on the sidelines. And as for exhaustion, paychecks come on Friday for a lot of people. Income tax is coming for a lot of people.

Love Bitcoin, super bull, we‚Äôre going to 100K this year... but... I‚Äôm also realistic. For those of you that don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôve got a 3 day weekend coming up in the US. Weekends are typically bad, long weekends are typically worse. And I know the US is not the only market for Bitcoin but it is a large one. Combine that with the fact that we keep getting rejected around 38/39 and I would say get ready for a rough 7 days. I‚Äôm not selling even 1 Satoshi, just sharing my thoughts for any newbies in case we go below 30K again and you think this run might be over. It‚Äôs not over, we‚Äôre basically at halftime, but it‚Äôs time to rest. Enjoy your weekend, and no matter what happens HODL! Whales can see what I can see as well as day traders. The whales will be playing their usual tricks to try and rob you for Sats. Traders will make matters worse by trying to take advantage. My advice is to ignore it all and focus on the future. 

One more thing, TA is useful because you can see what hundreds if not thousands of people are thinking; it‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy. We are clearly in a descending wedge, a couple more rejections and traders are going to start acting and it will likely get ugly.

With money comes power. Im curious (I haven't done this but have thought to), would turning your 12 seed words into a longer poem where only I recognize which are the key words work to record them and not increase risk of being stolen?

Just an innocuous story where, even though the 12 words are there, no one but me will know the words that are the seed. It's almost like having a 100 word password but the important bits only I know.

I only thought of this because remembering 12 random words can be hard, but a poem, even longer can be easier to memorize. It's why it's a popular memory tool.

Bitcoin was created to free us from centralized actors, be it people or institutions, but some of us are not comfortable unless there is someone or something lording over them I guess... Saylor opens the door to institutional investment, explains Bitcoin's benefit to society in a well articulated way from the perspective of an educated and experienced CEO of a tech company across countless interviews, shows the world that bitcoin is more than just neck bearded geeks in their mom's basement, sticks up for the Bitcoin community, creates a free educational online resource dedicated to bitcoin, debates the biased gold bugs, and so much more.

Then one time, in an effort to mitigate the energy use FUD and potentially bring more mining outside China to counter the threat of centralized Chinese mining you get these maximalists turning on him as though they forget the massive efforts he put in. Do 100 good things but still be shit on for doing one thing the maxis disagree with. It's too bad such a small loud few have to make the rest of us look like toxic cult assholes. I‚Äôm a buyer below 100k Human psychology is amazing. Few weeks ago people were disappointed we were stuck at 56k. Now we are celebrating the idea of going over 40k. Technical analysis is bullshit. All crypto is highly sensitive to news. One positive or negative tweet from the right person and all the technical analysis is nullified. It‚Äôs also really sad and nihilistic to just sit around trading something back and forth based on meaningless patterns. If you want to invest in bitcoin, do it because you believe in its value long term. I‚Äôm a hodler because I see value in it. Whether I win or lose, I will stay in it because it fills a needed role in the world. [The central bank of the Netherlands, DNB, has reversed its recent decision to tighten up the rules around withdrawals](https://tpow.app/655f6932)

Finally some good fucking news boys Lesson for those investing in btc. If you trade on leverage or margins you are at real and serious risk to get liquidated. Only trade on actual fiat you‚Äôve deposited and converted to crypto, that way you can HODL as long as you can. Imagine selling sub 100k Bitcoin is like goku. We're at the point in his fight with frieza when frieza just went to his 'semi- final' form and kicked the shit out of Goku and then killed off krillin with a goddoma.finger lazer...we just gotta wait 5 episodes for Goku to power up and turn super saiyan...super saiyan Bitcoin"

115;MasterCard Inc. Collaborates With Criptan To Launch Crypto Card;nlltnr;3;1622048322.0;BitcoinWide;"MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA) recently partnered with a leading crypto trading platform, Criptan, and electronic money institution, Pecunpay.

The collaboration has helped MasterCard in launching its first cryptocurrency card called CripytanCard in Western Europe. Cardholders can enjoy the option of using cryptos to make payments if they wish. Therefore this will do away with the need of having advance refills to the card.

As part of these efforts, Criptan will convert its digital currencies into traditional fiat currencies, progressively making way into the MasterCard network. Subsequently, Criptan will open the way for the use of crypto across all MasterCard accepting merchants globally. Equally, the cards will be able to withdraw cash from ATMs worldwide. Pecunpay played a vital role in the launch of the CriptanCard by integrating it with the former‚Äôs banking platform. As a result, this empowered CriptanCard to process transactions independently. 

MasterCard has been partnering with crypto platforms to leverage the increasing number of consumers coming into the cryptocurrency space in recent times. The payments processing company has been striving to bridge the gap between crypto and consumers, pacing the way for effortless utilization of the currencies daily.

I don't want to change my 24 words, I just want to create a new private key with those 24 words + a seed extension. Can Electrum or any other app do this or should I go through the command line to generate my new private key?

Edit: after a lot of research, testing, restoring... turns out ledger natively supports exactly what I was trying to do, and it does it by creating a second pin attached to the wallet with the extended phrase. I made a big deal out of something trivially easy to accomplish, but it was a fun learning opportunity.";5;"That would be a brand new wallet, you'd have to transfer. It would generate a new wallet.

That's a hypothetical way people protect against a $5 wrench attack (someone bashing you over the head for your private keys). You'd have one 24-word wallet with a small stash, while your main wallet is actually the 25th-word wallet where your real stash is. Yes, Electrum can do this, but remember Electrum is not a BIP39 wallet by default. You have to run the ""Restore wallet"" dialogue, choose ""BIP39"" and choose ""extension words"". Go slowly. These options are easy to miss  

Don't call it a 25th word. Use a multi-word passphrase. Have a look at diceware for ideas about strong multi-word passphrases  

Another option is to download and use the BIP39 tool  
https://iancoleman.io/bip39/  

.

But you only asked half the question. Which wallet app are you using which has a 24-word seed phrase? Why not use that wallet app to make a new wallet with the same seed phrase and a new passphrase? Yes, Electrum can do that. The 25th word is called the passphrase. You have to transfer the bitcoins from the old addresses (24 word seed) to the new addresses (24 words + passphrase). I would advice you to first download [this](https://iancoleman.io/bip39) or [same on github](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39) and see if you can regenerate the old addresses and private keys (preferably on an offline computer). Then add the passphrase and generate the new addresses and private keys. Then see if Electrum generates the same addresses with the passphrase. Only then transfer the bitcoin to the new addresses with Electrum. Not to an already generated 24 word seed."
124;Bitcoin/ Crypto IRA;nl371x;2;1621986073.0;fhqwhgadsy;"I keep hearing whispers about Bitcoin and Crypto IRA‚Äôs but everything I search seems spammy and scammy. 

Does anyone here use a service or platform they recommend? 

Is it better to just use whatever trading platform and figure out my own? 

Would love to trust professional crypto nerds to ‚Äòdiversify‚Äô... otherwise I‚Äôll just keep stacking sats as my only move. 

Forbes makes it sounds like I have to start one myself-

‚ÄòTo hold cryptocurrency in a retirement account, the account owner must make the investments through an LLC (limited liability company). The steps to take are as follows:
1. Establish and fund a self-directed IRA with a custodian of such retirement plans.

2. Form and register an LLC, which will be 100% owned by the IRA and, therefore, carry the same tax-advantaged status as the IRA. The income and expenses related to the assets will flow through the IRA LLC as required by the Internal Revenue Service. Cryptocurrency is considered property for federal tax purposes by the IRS, but because the assets are owned by a retirement account, gains are tax advantaged.
3. Using funds from the IRA, the LLC opens a business checking account (an IRA LLC is also referred to as a ‚Äúcheckbook IRA‚Äù). The checkbook puts the account owner in full control of the transaction (checkbook control), which is made simply by writing a check or wiring funds. The funds in the IRA LLC‚Äôs business checking account are for the sole purpose of investing in the digital assets (or any other alternative assets allowed through self-direction).
4. Open an account on a cryptocurrency exchange in the name (and tax number) of the IRA LLC. In addition to being purchased or traded on exchange platforms, digital assets may also be purchased through brokers or by investing in a fund that holds various digital currencies through private placement. In effect, the IRA purchases shares or directly invests as a limited partner.‚Äô 

I‚Äôm used to using as basic and simple a platform as Acorns. Im not going to start my own LLC. Thoughts?";1;"The way I see it, Bitcoin separates money and state. Bitcoin is a precious gift where we can have a form of money that is ""strong"" (even better than gold), can be sent to anywhere over the Internet, and (when stored properly) cannot be confiscated. No government can tell us if or when we can send Bitcoin to somebody else, nor can they dictate to whom we are ""allowed"" to send money, or how much. No government, no central bank can ""print"" Bitcoin and devalue it, like they've been doing to their fiat currencies.

Bitcoin offers us ""freedom of money"".

An IRA locks your money/wealth in a government ""jail"". They tell you all the rules: how much you can put in, when you can put it in, when you can take it out, how much you can take out, when you must take it out... they can change the rules on you after your money has been locked up. Furthermore, they will eventually confiscate it.

""Oh, but tax deferral and ... "" Stop! Think...

The long-term average ROI for Bitcoin is about 100% per year.

Leave your fiat money in the IRA/ROTH/401K (if employer matched).
Leave your Bitcoins in your own wallet, and add more Bitcoins as you are able to do so ""responsibly"". Be patient. In several years, your Bitcoin stash is likely to be worth millions of dollars. If you store it properly, the government cannot take it from you.

If you get old and want to buy something with your Bitcoins, say, a home, then you can pay long-term capital gains, about 20%. Think about it: you put in thousands which turned into millions and now you gotta pay one fifth as tax. So, you can only spend 4 million instead of 5 - boo, fucking hoo for you, so blue, go to the zoo, step in penguin poo...

If the taxes bother you that much, don't buy that home, rent it instead, and pay the landlord in satoshis. Leave the government out of it.

Or, if taxes bother you that much, wait an extra year or two, then your stash will likely be worth 10 million instead of 5. You pay the 20% tax and you have 8 million bucks. Only eight million.. boo fucking hoo for you...

There is no good reason to complicate your life and to risk losing all your IRA custodial Bitcoins to a hack, a crime, changing laws, or outright government confiscation."

Short answer is that your funds are safe and accessible regardless of what happens to the wallet company.  The seed phrase will allow you to access the funds at your address because the corresponding addresses and their keys can be mathematically derived from the seed phrase.

131;Open Letter to Michael Saylor and Elon Musk: 1 BTC = 1 BTC;nle8or;52;1622027037.0;nopara73;"Dear Mr Saylor and Mr Musk,

Over the years I have seen far too many heroes mercilessly slayed by Bitcoin‚Äôs immune system, because they failed to understand or adhere to first principles.  
Teaming up with the blacklisting miners and forming the Bitcoin Mining Council gives many of us, OG Bitcoiners, d√©j√† vu. It seems like you are struggling with a particular first principle, therefore I conclude the balls of the bulls are in great danger, UNLESS you learn that **1 BTC = 1 BTC**. Also called the **FUNGIBILITY** principle.

# What is the best money we might conceptualize?

Thousands of years ago, an Athenian gentleman, Aristotle, identified the **Properties of Good Money**. Although economists are still debating the details, the basic idea is this: money must be **durable, divisible, scarce, stable, acceptable, portable, and fungible**.  
Bitcoin ‚Äî *or another cryptocurrency, but most likely Bitcoin, and certainly not Dogecoin* ‚Äî will flippen the USD and become the most valuable currency. With the exceptions of stability, acceptability, portability and fungibility, Bitcoin fulfils the properties of good money. I regard stability and acceptability as meta properties. As the market capitalization of a currency grows, these properties get satisfied. Portability is also something well incentivized to be taken care of, although the challenges of making Bitcoin cheap and fast are far from trivial, the brainpower‚ö° directed towards achieving these goals is extraordinary.  
This leaves us with fungibility as the primary property to focus. The most important thing one can choose to work on is Bitcoin‚Äôs fungibility.

>Money in its various guises derives its usefulness from the fact that one can be relatively certain that a dollar received is a dollar able to be spent without friction or uncertainty ‚Äî Alastair Berg [\[src\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326438277_The_Identity_Fungibility_and_Anonymity_of_Money)

**Fungibility** **contributes to the quality of money**.  
Fungibility is a scale. It tells how interchangeable and indistinguishable individual units of a money are. [In his 2019 paper,](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326438277_The_Identity_Fungibility_and_Anonymity_of_Money) economist Alastair Berg states ‚ÄúThat the fungibility of money reduces the costs of exchange is well explored *(*[*Brunner and Meltzer, 1971*](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/journal_contribution/The_Uses_of_Money_Money_in_the_Theory_of_an_Exchange_Economy/6708833/1)*; see also* [*Banerjee and Maskin, 1996, p.958*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/maskin/files/a_walrasian_theory_of_money_and_barter.pdf)*;* [*Menger, 1892*](https://mises.org/library/origins-money-0)*)*‚Äù.  
This does not come as a surprise as contravening fungibility violates the fundamentals of money. It introduces friction in exchanges and makes people question their belief in the money itself. Berg continues, ‚ÄúFiat currency derives its usefulness from the likelihood that it will be acceptable in some future exchange, rather than having any intrinsic value or secondary uses.‚Äù

Fungibility of a currency ensures privacy of the individual.  
**Privacy is the individual‚Äôs ability to reveal themselves selectively to the world.** The adjective *private* is often used synonymously with the adjective *secret*. However, the latter‚Äôs noun form, *secrecy*, fails to capture the meaning of *privacy*, which leads to confusion over the terminology. A more legal strand of definitions [emerged in 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_to_Privacy_%28article%29), when privacy was first proposed to be a **fundamental human right** and defined as ‚Äúthe right to be let alone.‚Äù  
A currency lacking fungibility takes away the individual‚Äôs freedom to keep their financial matters personal and define the boundaries of their financial life; therefore, **lack of financial privacy is a direct consequence of inferior fungibility**. 

# In Conclusion

**Fungibility is king** in Bitcoin. Do not confuse the apparent lack of privacy in the system with a feature. It's not a feature, it's a bug, or rather a compromise, a result of some tradeoffs. Everyone in the community strongly values the privacy of the individual and so should you. Remember: **1 BTC = 1 BTC.**

*Don't shy away from diving deeper into the ocean of nyms and identities, check* *out my latest essay on* [*Privacy, Fungibility and Anonymity*](https://nopara73.medium.com/privacy-fungibility-anonymity-451d029355f7)*.*";19;"I'm so sick and tired of hearing about these 2 fucks. You think they give a shit what you think? They just wanna make money out of everyone > 1 BTC = 1 BTC

Whenever I read this I react with allergy against stupidity. These billionaires are still noobs in the bitcoin space. Even if they try to censor certain transactions with the miners in their mining council, there will be other miners who are willing to mine them with high enough network fee and enough wait time, worst case is it will play out exactly like the 2017 bcash and segwit fork war where we will have a bankrolled mining council chain and the people's chain. Their understanding of the protocol is still very limited, they just have deep pockets!!! DO NOT WORSHIP NOOBS WITH DEEP POCKET!!! 1 taco = 1 taco > 1 BTC = 1 BTC

and 1 piece of shit = 1 piece of shit 1 BTC = 1 BTC,

1 Michael Saylor = 111,000 BTC

. . . sure like to own me a Michael Saylor Bitcoin was always vulnerable to this. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not useful as a cash replacement I repeat the ""balls of the bull are in great danger"" mayday mayday! WTF are you talking about? The council or not, Bitcoin is still fungible. Like why would anyone give a shit about which pool mines which block? The council just wants to publish their energy usage and what energy sources they use is of little concern to me. Like the electricity you're using, do you care if the provider produced it with coal or nuclear or solar? It's still just the same electricity. The company can publish whatever they want and claim their electricity is ""greener"", it's still electricity to me (and maybe this is not a perfect example as you can switch electricity provider). And if they don't play by the rule, my node will just reject their blocks. 

Honestly I don't know why many are just so triggered by this council thing. Michael Saylor will be sacrificed like all other btc heroes. Furthermore, it is written in the numerology of his name. ‚ÄúThe one sacrificed for the foolishness of others‚Äù But Bitcoin is not fungible... You can easily distinguish a fresh created Bitcoin from a old created Bitcoin that were in account that you doesn't like... The government has started to black list BTC addresses. This means 1 BTC ‚â† 1 BTC. BTC has lost its fungibility, and hence, will lose its value. 

https://youtu.be/WCN-5JoGvS4 I know I'll get downvoted but please give this thought a chance.

There's a reason bitcoins from various scams are not able to be sold in exchanges, the latest example:  
[https://www.coindesk.com/us-treasury-department-blacklists-20-bitcoin-addresses-tied-to-alleged-north-korean-hackers](https://www.coindesk.com/us-treasury-department-blacklists-20-bitcoin-addresses-tied-to-alleged-north-korean-hackers)

If we are able to blacklist UTXOs that means it's not as fungible as it may seem at first sight.

The other thing to take into consideration is that Bitcoin is not anonymous it is pseudonymous. People may not be able to link your wallet to you, but they're able to know every single detail about your wallet.

Yes, Taproot and Schnorr signatures are improvements but we still have the underlying base layer built without deep privacy, anonymity and fungibility in mind.

It looks like you really value those 3 traits. Not trying to shill but there's a great alternative you should probably take a look at and you'll find great value in it. Your logic only makes sense when goods and services started to be valued in bitcoin I'm not sure it's fungible. I mean clearly many dark market users used bitcoin and ended up in jail and their bitcoin is not tainted. ""open letter"" on reddit lmfao you think anyone will read this shit you‚Äôre not correct, bitcoin is portable, that‚Äôs why people choose bitcoin over gold, it‚Äôs way easier to move it, store it, keep it safe. > Teaming up with the blacklisting miners

136;Bitcoin : The case for degrowth.;nlksns;8;1622045710.0;mangrsll;" What you are about to read here is not a very common theory.

If you understand that the wealth created by an economy derives from the energy consumed to produce a good or a service, you understand as well that our economy‚Äôs future is directly linked to our ability to produce enough energy to maintain a growing wealth.

The problem is that our energy production depends on natural resources (oil, coal, uranium, natgas, etc.), and those resources are finite. Since *The* *Limits to Growth* first edition, many studies and report have been produced to demonstrate that at some point the availability of primary energy sources (of all sources, the most important being oil) will cease to grow and will start un inevitable decline. Such a decline will also put a definitive stop to the unprecedented worldwide economy growth that we have been experiencing since the industrial revolution.

In human history, most of the economic systems that have preceded modern capitalism haven‚Äôt handled well these situations and economic decline in wealth creation (or degrowth) quickly ended up in civilizational collapses.

**And what does it have to do with Bitcoin ?** 

Bitcoin could well be the perfect parachute for our worldwide economic system and could prevent our global economy from collapsing. 

Until now, whenever the economy of a region was slowing down, the only way we found to relaunch the system was to create money, either by printing it (central banks), or by lending it (private banks). It has worked fine for decades, but this system is clearly starting to reach its limits and another financial crisis is closer than ever, only 12 years after the last one (The peak of conventional oil occurred around 2007/08).

Bitcoin, just like natural resources, is limited, not only in the number of coins, but also in the pace of the creation of these coins. This is extremely important as it is becoming an increasingly promising store of value that is slowly starting to divert money flows from going to productive investments. If we take the example of Tesla or Microstrategy for example, they have made more money by storing BTC than by selling cars or software. It‚Äôs an incredible example of how it might start to incentivize companies to save money rather than invest in production (in the illusive pursue of infinite growth).

I don‚Äôt think many people have seen Bitcoin under this angle, but this could be the strongest argument in favor of the environment‚Ä¶ If Tesla is making more money by holding bitcoins rather than making cars, what will incentivize them in building new (polluting) factories, building more cars and therefore using more resources ?

Inspired by the Buckminster Fuller article : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nl3yy8/bitcoin\_pow\_and\_its\_consequences\_predicted\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nl3yy8/bitcoin_pow_and_its_consequences_predicted_in/)";3;"You got me excited at the beginning but then lost me at the end. 

You‚Äôre confusing monetary systems and economic value with biophysical (energy, environment) constraints. I agree that they are connected, but not in the way you propose. 

Let‚Äôs assume Bitcoin soon becomes a stable and widely accepted currency. Therefore it functions  as a store of value for consumers and businesses. Ok good. 

Now let‚Äôs say we actually transition to a less carbon intensive economic system. This means more renewables, less fossil fuels (limited to essential heavy industries), and assume Jevon‚Äôs paradox does not apply (ie efficiency gains in renewables does not lead to higher total energy usage that is typically fossil fuel based). The world will begin to see the limits these renewable energy systems have vs. fossil fuel based systems (lower energy density, storability, demand vs availability, etc.). Additionally, the scale of land usage required for renewable energy systems needed to support our current society will not be feasible for most countries (you can‚Äôt eat electricity). This will result in growth slowing as we no longer have access to the same level of energy (see correlation of Material Footprint vs GDP or energy usage vs GDP). This will likely also increase market volatility as societies try to learn how to deal with not having access to power 24/7 across all situations. So governments are likely to continue printing money as a way to stimulate the system. This would have the effect of stabilizing or increasing asset prices for a time (there is eventually a point at which the market won‚Äôt accept this either). 

In this scenario I see why you think Bitcoin could help people stabilize their purchasing power. However, this is only considering the ‚Äúmarket economy,‚Äù which is all anyone really thinks about these days anyway. 

The market economy is what we see reflected in the price of goods and services. The real economy is represented by the energy, material, and labor we utilize to provide products and services. The market operates based on the amount, timing, and risk associated with cash flows (theoretically). The real economy operates based on energy returned on energy invested. Net energy available to the system is what allows us to turn on the lights, fly off to a nice vacation, or buy groceries at the store. Nothing happens without energy, the fact that it is so artificially cheap today is the only reason we are able to do all the shit we do. The price of energy does not reflect the material value it creates (and that value is then typically captured or stolen by the elite).

So if we lower the amount of net energy available in the system, we must lower the amount of materials available to be processed (because there is less energy to access these things), and we then lower the amount of services we provide or stuff we make. So, something like Bitcoin, with its insane energy consumption, is now asking the people of the world to spend less energy on actual services and goods, so we can have a token that represents a store of wealth for the affluent.

This doesn‚Äôt seem like a tool that can stabilize a degrowth movement but maybe I‚Äôm missing some nuances on the subject. To be clear, I‚Äôm all for degrowth. I think it‚Äôs the only group of thought leaders proposing ideas that are ecologically feasible. I think the hardest part for people to grasp is that the ‚Äúprices‚Äù and ‚Äúmarket values‚Äù we see today are just a fever dream of the end of an economic system that is meeting the physical wall of ecological limits. We need to shift our mindsets to stabilizing access to important goods and services and worry less about the value of our portfolios. I would say that it incentivizes people to make \*better\* investments and also spend less on consumption.

Constantly devaluing fiat incentivizes people to throw money away at consumption or at any investment promising even a small return.

By contrast, a deflationary currency incentivizes people to save, consume less, and only invest in projects with a higher return.

Yes, I think such a currency is better for long term sustainability.  But bad for short term economic growth (as it's currently measured) You're on to something.

My seed phrase is:

Is this okay?






/s Or never give the seed words to anyone, anywhere (except in places like your testament and the like). Anyone asking you for the seed words as some sort of ""requirement, ""policy"", ""standard practice"", etc. *is a crook and a scammer* or (at best), an incompetent idiot.

Bottom line is there is *never* a need to *anyone* or *any entity* (financial, legal, etc.) to know your seed phrase.

Period. No exceptions. Yes people. Be safe never tell your seed words to anyone except to me I'd even say ""never even type them offline, on a computer that will subsequently be online"".

Keep that 100% physically separate from your web-browsing computers. This should be the welcome message to the subreddit when you join. Also, dont take pictures of it with your phone No service will EVER ask for your seed phrase. None of them. EVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. 

Any email, text, facebook message, instagram, Snapchat, tinder hit up, grinder, signal, telegram WhatsApp, WeChat, that Korean one, that Japanese one, and anything else that I‚Äôm missing that asks for your seed phrase is a total SCAM. What‚Äôs a seedword? balls

Obviously a joke - don‚Äôt do it The only seed phrase you should be yelling at the top of your lungs is the secret seed phrase you use after you‚Äôre done disappointing a nice lady (or guy). 

I suggest something like: 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry I wasted those several seconds‚Äù or ‚ÄúI got really nervous‚Äù or my favourite ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see myself out‚Äù. Never type the seed words into any computer. Only ever type them into another hardware wallet when you go to do a backup. Are you sure? Because they spell something funny My seedwords are:

Getting involved with Bitcoin without first taking the time to learn is a lot like paddling out into double overhead waves as a beginner: you‚Äôre asking to get smoked. Bitcoiners know how to think long term, and they are comfortable with the concept of short term pain for long term gain.{}

Coinbase fees are huge, eToro is overpriced and you can‚Äôt move the coins. 

Then I‚Äôm also looking to move it to a secure place, as trust wallet and exchanges are getting hacked too often for my liking. 

Suggestions greatly appreciated.";7;"Coinbase Pro + Ledger. I started with Coinbase back in 2017, it was an accessible and easy app to work with, gradually over time I became very miffed at their prices, so I jumped ship.

THEN , very recently I discovered Coinbase Pro actually have far lower fees (0.5%), so I‚Äôve installed the app and will use it, as it is auto linked to my Coinbase account, there is no faffing with ID , setup and waiting.

I feel more confident in the exchange now they are on NASDAQ

I am not tech savy enough to cold-store anything, so I mitigate exchange risk by splitting between Coinbase, Bittrex snd Binance , with a little fun fund in Revolut ( can‚Äôt move out of Revolut, so its a speculative trading fund, small and just for fun so I don‚Äôt fiddle with my bags too much ( oh! , I say!!), but still get my dopa fix

I also have a Coinbase Wallet, but I‚Äôve not used it as I don‚Äôt understand the risks associated with it A hardware wallet such as a Ledger or Trezor for the storage part perhaps? US exchanges - consider Coinbase Pro, Kraken Pro, or Gemini AT.  Specifically Gemini offer limited free withdrawals.
Hardware wallets - for BTC only, consider Coldcard. Coinbase pro and then straight to the trezor for me Swan bitcoin or celsius Swan Bitcoin (0.99% purchase fees, free transfers) onto a BitBox02 wallet"
149;Nic Carter claims that Elon Musk is not the proper person to lead the green Bitcoin debate;nm3jy4;149;1622107442.0;smmedianews;;18;"Bitcoin doesn't need anyone. Why do we have to give attention to this clown at all?

He poses for nothing and nobody here. When people decide he‚Äôs just as dumb as Justin sun and stop listening to him the better btc will be üòÇ Ever since Tesla entered the crypto space in Feb, Elon is responsible for bringing in his weak handed followers into crypto. When Elon tweets, his followers either buy more or FUD out. There is no green debate. Bitcoin naturally leads miners to better sources of energy because it is profitable for them, there are bigger issues to be focused on. Don't let the main stream media sheep your mind.    Not your keys not your coin. TAKE YOUR COINS OF EXCHANGES. Don't be afraid to mine, don't be afraid of non kyc options, they might be more expensive but who cares the value will go up and it will pay for itself. Hodlhodl is lit af. Broadcast your transactions through tor. Samourai wallet is very easy to use. this scambag needs to be banned from all crypto, he‚Äôs only looking for ways to do damage. Proper? Absolutely not, and neither is Nic for that matter--his speaking style on Lex Friedman's podcast says it all. That's really Andreas' domain and no one has been able to do it better since in this space. 

But, Elon has a much larger profile than just about anyone else on the planet, and while that has many drawbacks (him crashing the price on fud in shorterm) it also makes people who otherwise dismissed bitcoin as a fad to take notice of it and the progress we've made. This maybe a more generous perception of most people's ability to think for themselves, but I think global inflation and Tesla recording it's first non-carbon credit quarterly profit may be a good starting point for other's to explore this tech. 

I see it as a necessary evil at this point given his creation and continued exposure to the most compelling and impactful tech of the 21st century and beyond. My cat claims Bitcoin before Elon does, hail your new overlord.

He only eat and sleep, no bullshit about energy. Musk is not the proper person to lead anything. His blatant market manipulation to fit his own agenda and play to his over inflated ego needs to be stopped.His fan boys have put him on such a high pedestal that they take everything he says as gospel, like he is the messiah. I personally think he‚Äôs 90% full of shit. Just a megalomaniac with a lot of money who‚Äôs read too many sci-if novels. Elon Skum can lead his poor-little-rich-boy self back into the African emerald mines that fostered his head start in life.

Those who warm their nose in his crack are welcome to follow him. Please refraining from associating pet coin pumping car salesman with BTC. Why are you still keep talking about Musk? Come on, stop this crying Is Nick Carter even still a thing????? He probably isnt. But he is someone who could help. To make bitcoin green, the only thing needed is more and cheaper mining hardware. Flood the markets with cheap asics. That will drive up difficulty, reduce profitability per watt, shift costs from hardware to energy and make intermittent mining with excess renewable energy profitable and mining with fossile fuel powered energy unprofitable. Tesla has some good chip designers, access to advanced fabs they could easily make a mining chip, and even sell it along with their solar roofs. >However, Carter highlighted that encouraging Bitcoin miners to be more honest about their energy mix is a good suggestion regardless of who makes it, alluding to the newly formed¬†Bitcoin Mining¬†Counci Remember Elon Musk is not a rocket scientist, he hires them! The Merlin ecosystem begins with the Vaults. As users stake in the Merlin vaults, the system algorithm will optimized an  auto-compounding mechanism which will  compound users' assets for maximum return"

Tesla likely bought its $1.5 billion in bitcoin at about $34,700 a piece. In the company's Q1, Tesla's bitcoin stash was the best performing part of the carmaker's business. 

Now, unless there is a recovery in the price of bitcoin between now and July 1, Tesla shareholders should brace themselves for an impairment in the company's Q2 earnings report.";29;"How about we stop bringing him up then? Fuck that scammer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c-FGwDDc-s8 Unless they already sold it and Musk lied about it on Twitter.

Musk is a bullshitter, you can't take him at his word. Elon Musk is still an indecisive, manipulative scumbag. Only kids idolise the guy because he makes rockets and he is their Iron Man fantasy come to life. He knows the power of his tweets, he refuses to understand Bitcoin and is being reckless by tweeting complete bollocks almost everyday. Besides, Bitcoin does not need Elon. Fuck Elon. Very low quality post. 80% upvote? wtf can we stop talking about this scambag? he has no place here, especially after trying to destroy bitcoin for months and ruining so many people‚Äôs lives. Does anyone know Tesla‚Äôs wallet? I‚Äôll check üòÇ They bought at 29k He took profits then posted FUD to dump the market. Fuck him, we don't need him, and we don't want him. Hopefully this is the best motivation for the other people in charge at Tesla to strong-arm Musk into shutting up. Blah blah blah Nothing would make me happier than watching tesla go bankrupt, and have all it's assets bought up by real car companies for pennies on the dollar. Fuck you mr.musk Never trust the MUSKrat. Buying BTC to float his revenue. With more and more companies selling EV he will not be selling his clean sir credits for profit and the true rat will show. Fake company profits not off EVs. Now should MUSKrat split up his company with the borning company amd SpaceX then those companies may show profit but his EVs is done. Good fuck him **We are rooting for the first major institutional investment to fail now?!**

What?!? Guys if Tesla fails from investing in Bitcoin that‚Äôs a horrible horrible precedent compared to succeeding with it. 

I‚Äôm getting get off this sub, this proves you guys are nothing but hateful assholes who say things that are far worse than anything Elon tweeted... but that doesn‚Äôt matter, right? Double standards and all? 

Goodbye, hope you get your heads straight some day. Hateful people usually don‚Äôt, though... Lol Wow so many people getting mad at Musk for stating some stuff about bitcoin which is partially true. You all loved it when he came out pumping and buying. Now he says some stuff which we already knew, and it's manipulation all of a sudden? Besides, bitcoin was probably due for a correction and leveraged longs were looking for a reason to sell. Not sure why you guys are angry for being able to buy bitcoin at a cheaper price... > Elon didn't say anything about it

In 2021 Feb Tesla announced its 2020 Dec Bitcoin purchases. The announcement listed every purchase - the amount and the price  

Tesla sold all these coins in 2021 Mar, near the price peak. The sale has not been announced yet even if bitcoin price recovered they would still have to account an impairment loss, as accounting rules are literally moronic Getting tired of seeing his name in this sub reddit. We should all just stop talking about him because the more we do, the more relevant he becomes to the space, which will confuse the newcomers into believing he is Satoshi himself. Impairment in companies Q2 earnings report?

üòÇ LoL

Elon will fucking pump this market with a few tweets then sell. 

Welcome to institutional adoption. Can everyone just STFU about that asshole already? Title is objectively false and bares little resemblance to the post content. You are trying to say that his ego shot himself in the foot? Can‚Äôt we get a bot around here that comments on any post where musk or Tesla is mentioned that links to articles pointing out manipulation, fallacies, etc? If I was a juge I would send him to prison. Elon maybe the person known as satoshi? Lmao so funny watching you ppl go from idolizing this dude to shitting on him in a week"
154;Many people are calling for the Bitcoin bull run to be over... here's my strongest case for why it isn't!;nljpt9;0;1622042854.0;stellarowl12;;1;It's not.
155;Wallet fingerprinting and other privacy issues in Bitcoin Core;nlhb5z;6;1622036445.0;prayank_gahlot;"After reviewing this PR and few others as well I think you should not expect privacy to be improved in Bitcoin Core (node and wallet) 

Anyone who cares about privacy should never use Bitcoin Core: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18418";3;"It's a feature.. anyone can audit the chain and check for inflation bug. Privacy is achieved 2nd layer. Lightning does it. Coinjoin does it. Coinjoin just existing makes Bitcoin fungible. If you want real privacy on anything to do with the internet, not just Bitcoin, you must do your due diligence.  It isn't as simple as using a privacy coin. You have to get around KYC, use Postal Money Orders, Tor, Etc. If you know enough to care about this then you know enough to know that you should just use coin control anyway.

Though arguably if wallet fingerprinting is your main concern then your best defense may be to use the most common wallet & default settings. Anybody who cares about privacy will not reuse any addresses, and will never need to use `avoidpartialspends`  

The Core wallet supports user coin control. Users should choose their own inputs, and the order of their outputs to avoid wallet fingerprinting  

All wallet apps have a fingerprint if the user does not choose coin control, or if the wallet app doesn't support coin control. The most sophisticated anti-fingerprint technique is common to many wallets - random ordering of the outputs. It's not much, but better than nothing"
156;Bitcoin pizza guy who squandered $365M has no regrets;nl2972;249;1621983139.0;patriceac;;71;"Nor should he. It legitimized bitcoin [removed] In what way did he squander it? It was barely worth anything at all at the time. Nothing was stopping anyone else from buying 10k BTC and holding it until now. If he squandered that much money, we all did. Wonder how big his bag is. He did not squander $365 M. Anyone who thinks he did is already picking out a new Lambo whilst counting their SHIB. What a legend This frigging guy! He paved the way, forever epitomized!

He got what money cannot buy!

&#x200B;

God bless him! by that logic everyone lost out on a billion dollars because we didn't buy 25000 coins when it was 2 cents each. Of course the logic is flawed and makes zero logical sense. FuckinLegend Damn. He chose to hodl on his orange neck beard instead It‚Äôs so funny how people don‚Äôt know the full story of Laszlo. I think it‚Äôs one of the most misunderstood stories in the Bitcoin space. I constantly have to tell people in real life what actually happened How is it squandering? That's like if the value of USD suddenly exploded tomorrow. Would every purchase anyone's ever made up until now have been ""squandering""? No. You can't compare transactions made years ago to current monetary values. Currency doesn't work like that. ‚ÄòSquandered‚Äô ‚Ä¶lol Total Chad. We should start a Bitcoin ""GoFundMe"" for him lol.

Absolute legend. The tax on that. Cost basis $20 ü§£ So now it's ""squandered?"" So he basically used Bitcoin for the purpose it was created NYPost will always go the cheap nasty angle. This guy is a legend. We celebrate the f'n anniversary for pizzas-sake. Please put this cherished piece of btc history on ""endthefud"" site so we can remember it as we love it, (the genesis of btc pricing) instead of ""squandering"" it. Ehat an asshat article title. There is good reason to believe that Satoshi pushed him to spend btc instead of hoarding it. Repost Is it too much to hope for $40k bitcoin when you wake up every morning? You know what?  I believe him. no brains for pizza guy anyways he doesnt feel it This guy is one of my bitcoin heroes. Why is no one talking about this papa John's owner who's a billionaire Ok I would pay more for some good pizza. BULLSHIT (poor bugger) Of course not, how can you regret something !) years ago; There is nothing he could do so why dread on it; This is what I tell myself as I got into crypto this year and not last year. If you let regret take hold it really messes you up $365M? That's a lot of dough. He payed $40 in Bitcoin not $365M

If you think otherwise, please at least be consistent and also obsess about the fact that every Pizza you bought back then with fiat, you could have bought Bitcoin instead. How much money did YOU ""squander"" away this way? I doubt he would have held his BTC that long. You could also say every dollar that was not spent on Bitcoin back then would now be worth X. I know its a funny story but honestly this comparison/extrapolation is nonsense. This is a good example of ""if you need to sell, never sell all your Bitcoin"". If you made you millions on Bitcoin please send this guy a thank you pizza The whole media framing doesn't understand how important these experiments were.

But the bitcoin community remembers and both ends of that, pizza for bitcoin, are just great :) Do I regret not holding and laminating my old charizard pokemon card that would be worth over 300 grand now? You bet I do. But who could tell? They look tasty though so lets leave it at that Keep waiting... in a few months, he might even make money üëçüèª yeah but the fees now are cray cray didn't him keep mining at the time tho? How much does he have now??? This story is overdone honestly. If he had that much then why wouldn‚Äôt he still have some?? I doubt he gives a shit because he‚Äôs probably still sitting on a huge stack of it and it‚Äôs just funny to him how much people care about such a historical reference point that actually had helped grow BTC and all crypto really‚Ä¶ Two words! STOP LYING!! Everybody is dumb No regrats Gigachad Really?...No regrets? Of course he regrets, but he can't say that to the camera make him looks like little b lol Ehh its always the ego that stops us from being sincere despite having nothing to lose. I mean whats the point of lying about that, we all know he deeply regrets it and probably cries at night so this just makes him seem like a sore loser too proud to tell the truth. HE CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH! Ridiculous. What I mean by this is that the reason Bitcoin has value to buy pizza etc is because the current state of affairs with the banking system is such that only those that are part of the corrupt financial system have access to banking resources. Its the same with the legal system where your wealth determines the outcome of litigation. Bitcoin is an evolutionary response to this dystopian government and financial corruption. Its ridiculous that things have come to this. He would have only lost his keys anyway, then have sleepless nights thinking about his hard drive in some land fill out of town..
At least pizza is closure.. transaction done,  enjoy üçï I was actually trying to look up the guy who actually got the Bitcoin, very cool rippppp

*imagine how much pizza you can get with 10,000 BTC* People aren't wired to expect a 400K% (or whatever) return on an asset. It had literally never happened before. We shouldn't pretend we would have been any more prescient than Mr. Sturdivant.

I know for a fact that if I had started mining when he did, I would have done something similar. I would have for sure sold when BTC hit $1 and I would feel lucky to get out ""before the crash"". 

Then I would kick myself for the next 10 years. I am very glad I didn't get in early. I'm pretty good at not worrying about stuff that would require a time machine to fix. Sounds like the Bitcoin pizza guy has the right attitude. Why would he Neutron Q Real Estate There‚Äôs no way he wouldn‚Äôt have sold anyway. As soon as it turned into 5k he would have probably said no way I‚Äôm taking this and running.

Unless he was in a coma, no way would he have let it grow pass 1 million. I mean it‚Äôs not like he wasn‚Äôt still investing it Bitcoin after buying the pizza lol Title is stupid, if you inflate the dollar backwards 50 years you can make basic shit sound crazy too. My now husband spent like 8 coins on blackmarket acid and we were just happy not to die His head is funny. Absolutely he's a legend. Classic expression I would never eat pizza again!!!! Lol
I wish I just had 5 bitcoin I don‚Äôt give a fuck what he says.... anyone who spent $365 million on a pizza is going to have regrets. Idiot. Pure idiot. He has regrets.  365$ million of them. We will see what he says in 4 more years when it‚Äôs in the billions. What will it take for him to admit he bought back in?

We all know he studied the charts and put some more pizza money in. yes, he has regrets He has regerts! Amarite He has regrets."

Keep these scammers busy a long time and waste their time. Is it just you and me ? I mean, even though I'm convinced the guy is a scammer, I cannot stop myself to say ""Hi"" or something. I would blow you for 0.35 BTC Lol you broke the machine. Eternal loop. Ask him what you do with the .35 BTC again üòÇ ‚ÄúYes you are wrong‚Äù LOL these people are scum For a small donation of 0.35BTC you too can help a scammer scam others.

The money you will receive back depends on you buying something that will produce bigger X return. Why they don't use their own funding to produce that same X return then? 

I.e. they will he take 1 btc to give you 3 btc back. That means he could make 3 btc himself investing with that same 1 btc. So you are going to be more profitable than him 3x times.

I can only speak personally when I say I truthfully am not here just for the money; but for me Bitcoin has made me question everything; if our entire education from pre-k to university conditions us to fall for government scams and keeping us in the dark with financial literacy, it makes you lose trust in those systems you‚Äôve been taught your whole life to trust and not question. 

Question.

There‚Äôs that word again. 

Bitcoin makes you question what you once did not think about before.

All those questions you had, maybe as a kid, that your parents were too conditioned to answer. Like, ‚Äúmommy, why do you have to pay taxes on buying, saving, and using your money when they can print as much as they want?‚Äù ‚ÄúMommy, why do we have to work 9-5 when I could do my job in 2-3 hours and ‚Äú‚Äù mommy why can‚Äôt you and daddy get more than 1 week of vacation time a year?‚Äù

If you do listen to the news, you are misinformed. 

News today is more from loud activists than from journalists. I dont get it. Nothing in that article is incorrect. The increased use of PCs did drive up household energy consumption and increased use of fossil fuels. From a climate change perspective PCs are bad, but they are incredibly useful so no-one cares. Same is true of cars and airplane flights. Morale of the human story: whenever and wherever energy is spent, value is being created.

In fact, this is a universal truth. Anything that is not absorbing energy is merely going down the entropy to become nothing.

PoS enthusiasts, you have been warned, lol It's like pottery, it rhymes Forbes is a FUD machine Whataboutism is never a compelling argument.

EXXON should be the fucking target. Meanwhile we bury nuclear fuel because of stupidly using it to boil kettles and turn on lamps that most people don't bother turning off, let alone the amount used to light empty cities at night. We need aneutronic fusion. The inefficiency and power use of bit coin compared to other coins  is a thing though This is actually hilarious Word Processing and Email were to greatly reduce or eliminate the use of paper.    
It did just the opposite.   People print everything x10. Funny how if you have access to your own power source, say solar panels at home you can run bitcoin mining on any scale if you have enough power. Therefore you‚Äôve effectively made your own money printing operation. 

No wonder they don‚Äôt like it. The offer of free money seems to be the solution to the global warming = hoax narrative. Kind of ironic. They went with this line of attack because calling it racist would be too much of a stretch. Computers, cows, Christ even the fish farts from the schools of fish are bad for the environment. What‚Äôs next the air we exhale? Every innovation goes to a phase like this. Fortunately we did not have Twitter back in ‚Äò99 to discuss every little thing and blow it up. Looks like someone was trying to short Amazon at the time But may be this time there is higher amount of energy consumption and climate change is real Bitcoin, burning energy to make fools gold You‚Äôre forgetting to mention the huge bubble burst just a year later."

Before I had any Bitcoin, I would think of anyone talking about that stuff as someone looking for the quickest place to lose their money.

I thought it was a place to buy hope for riches but at the same time you're sure it would never happen.

It looked like they were self sabotaging.

Then, which was in 2017, I was 18 and these guys (my friends) were busy buying BTC, ETH and all that.

I thought of them as soon to be millionaires whenever they mentioned Bitcoin because I never understood what it really meant and whatever.

But then the real jackpot happened..

The CEO of one website named mentor course review, taught me a cute little about BTC and sent me $150 worth of the coin.

This was around the period when BTC was moving from 30k to 40k. (December 2020)

I left the coin in my wallet and every new day I logged in I was around $20 richer.

LoL

It felt almost like striking gold in California.

So that was it, I became a preacher of Bitcoin.

Why not?

EDIT: 

The best outcome might be Musk getting a set of mining customers for totally green energy like solar panels, while those panels wait for other buyers.

The worst outcome would be as OP suggests miners making a cartel that controls you more and more. Bleh

Wait and see, hope it goes well. Fuck yeahhhh! why would something impacting the environment to this scale not be regulated?

by definition as bitcoin scales up it will require state level actors to monitor it: it already does. you think you can just start a profitable mine without going though a ton of bureaucracy regarding power infrastructure?

If your wallet is anonymous, And sent elsewhere you would be safe. Regulations are being put in place to require businesses offering DeFi to identify who owns the wallets. An interesting debate 4sure. saved yourself some nice time and money with a lawyer BlockFi said they sent out over 1,000 BTC and was able to recover about 85% of them (if I recall correctly). I forgot which interview it was. LOL smooth move So is this transaction going to be a taxable event for you? üòÜü§£ BlockFi's T&C, which you agreed to without reading, specifies you cannot withdraw funds that are not rightfully yours. The CEO confirmed this on YouTube. If you had withdrawn the coins they would've asked for them back and if you would've refused, they would've pressed charges against you. Isn't it a bit bad that they can do a reversal from your own wallet? illegal in most places to not make reasonable effort to repay falsely issued currency

likely they'd have tried to fuck your arse raw

possible you could escape relevant jurisdictions if you were able to successfully withdraw though

still, this would require uprooting your life... and I will be more than that with Nexo https://twitter.com/NexoFinance/status/1397867181237485571 If you withdrew you would have been able to keep all the funds legally. BlockFi will not risk a legal battle over the funds because if they lose it would set president and the amount lost was not worth the downside of an adverse outcome. Only 100 people were incorrectly credited and 92% has been recovered. Good luck withdrawing from BlockFi - it took me 6 days (!!!!) to withdraw crypto deposited with them after this occured.

I did not get a bonus, but figured it would be a safe move to get off the platform for now."

Do you imagine crypto currency is more popular than fiat? Do you imagine tens or hundreds of cryptocurrencies? Do you imagine our normal life with fiat will be same but we will use cryptocurrency for some other things? What do you think?;5;"Bitcoin becomes the reserve currency of choice for most nations upsetting the petrodollar and increasing against all fiat currencies. It replaces the current free-floating international currency system and becomes the yardstick by which our economies are measured. 

Other blockchains will fulfill useful roles in the ecosystem becoming decentralized ledgers that allow us to own and control our identities, titles, deeds, and other public information. This will replace many governmental functions that are primarily concerned with public record keeping.

Micropayments, decentralized organizations, crowdfunding, p2p markets, the list goes on and on.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* Let‚Äôs all hope to god that they win. If money you're making from mining is taxable then you should be able to deduct the money you spend on mining hardware. This theory is logically correct, but not in the context of normal payout-based cooperative pooled mining unless you are the one that found the block, since pooled mining is often not coinbase-direct but rather transaction-payouts.

If they win, great, but if they lose, the reason will be along these lines, and it *should* open the way to tax-free mining income for solo miners. I hope they win!! They have to win! This seems like an open and shut case.  They. Better. Win!!! You pay tax on the power you use, you pay tax on the computer hardware you buy, you pay taxes on the house in which the equipment is in and the property‚Ä¶ Geez Louise cut someone a break How did the IRS know they mined those coins? This is how it works in Canada. No trade, no sell, no tax. Refusing to acknowledge as legal tender, then insisting it be taxed as legal tender is the most government thing I can think of This sounds like a landmark case‚Ä¶ Make taxation theft again The + IRS = Theirs weak argument. The tax is on the profit, not any notion of ""tangible property"". If you do your taxes right you can actually write off any losses or expenses involved in the mining. Just like any other business. If 50 million people refused to do their taxes. What would governments do? Alright maybe they‚Äôd audit the biggest offenders.

If 6 billion people, tomorrow, said they‚Äôre never doing taxes ever again. What would governments do?

The answer is: Nothing. Looks like the China bots are out in force applauding unfair taxation. Anyone in a sub dedicated to a currency that's main component is decentralization, screaming that earned money through BTC needs to be taxed is either a fucking idiot or pushing an agenda. How about ""it shouldn't be taxed at all""? Good. Should not have been taxable in the first place as a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù. The government is always looking for more ways to steal from its citizens. They should have some kind of crowd funding wow this is something I hope those guys will win a win would be a big day for crypto I am also wondering how tax will be on my staked rewards that i never sell. Let's leave it to the XTZ community to lead the pack again ROFL I was wondering that myself.  Glad someone did the research on it to back up the theory. >Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money.

lmao it's right there in the sidebar... So, to me, this case has a few details worth discussing. This isn't exactly like creating a cake or something, when you receive mined crypto, they have a very definable value at the moment you receive them. But lets assume that the couple here is correct and they don't need to pay tax at the moment they receive the staking rewards. I don't think its necessary to pay income tax on those coins the year you receive them, but the value basis should be recorded and tracked for when you do sell them. 

For example, if you get $100 worth of mined bitcoin, don't pay anything, but track the date and value. Two years later, those coins you received are worth $200 and you sell them. I would think you pay income tax rates (based on your income the year you sell them) on $100 and capital gains rates on the $100 growth. In this scenario, that $100 is kind of like deferred income. A sale of a portion would pay taxes in accordance with those rules with a portion as income tax and capital gains tax. 

I'm no tax professional, there may be better examples or interpretations of how this should work. This makes it important to adopt a privacy standard from mining, such as mining only via TOR. They‚Äôre thinking of the coins created by staking as interest. üôåüôè I don't see the fed paying taxes on the shit they print... > not taxable until traded because they establish the creation of property. 

How can it possibly represent the creation of property when the supply of Bitcoin (and I assume also Tezos) is fixed? Those coins would be ""created"" with or without the specific miner's participation. Their participation only determines who they are awarded to. It's much more akin to any award that vests according to a set schedule, like stock grants, which are (you guessed it) taxable when awarded. Do they want to call it inventory? The IRS taxes inventory. Personally, I can‚Äôt see the difference between a crypto staking reward and a stock dividend that‚Äôs reinvested. In both cases, the value of that dividend can fluctuate and you can end up owing more than it‚Äôs worth. They should be taxed the exact same way. Makes sense. Imagine if someone makes $100,000 worth of crypto from staking rewards. The next day it tanks 50%. Now you‚Äôre down to $50,000 but have to pay taxes on $100,000. How is this fair? Am I understanding this correctly? The fundamental flaw in their position is going to be that they aren't actually creating an asset. They are very likely mining or staking to a pool and that pool is giving them crypto in return. It would be like trying to avoid tax by being paid in assets, the value of the assets at the time of receipt is taxable as income. They will win as well, as long as the courts don't go unhinged liberal douche bag crazy like the rest of the country.

I think it allows PTLCs which enables RGB to put smart contracts on Lightning with significant privacy, scalability, and utility improvements. It allows for more lightweight smart contracts.  It allows for cheaper more private multisig.  It allows schnorr signatures. This likely enables cheaper transactions for different uses.  Taproot and schnorr both enable some significant privacy benefits, especially on boarding to Lightning and with coinswap.  Schnorr adds some interesting possibilities when combined with privacy tech and Lightning onboarding as well.  It also allows for the next upgrade to enable cross input signature aggregation which is a significant privacy boost.  Again not an expert, hopefully someone smarter will answer better

I don't know what Elon can offer miners if coal happens to be the cheapest energy in a certain case. Except buy out their facility and then demolish it. That seems too expensive to me. Even for him. Michael Saylor has proven that he is a confident and Savvy businessman he understand everything Elon Musk says on record or on video and have a huge consequence.

It adds a layer of privacy, and could make whatever these dicks are trying to do a bit harder That's not exactly a hot take, it's what everyone is saying and has been saying for days. Your post hasn't added anything new to the conversation.

That being said, miners already have private meetings with each other and the companies that manufacture mining hardware. They just don't publicize it and try to make a big deal out of it like some attention-seeking billionaires on social media.

And what I just wrote isn't a hot take either, lots of people have said that. Saylor probably begging Musk to tweet something good about bitcoin. Probably trying to get Musk to buy more but Musk is waiting for better price. Musk calls Saylor a fraud. Then Saylor spits on the camera and Musk hangs up Short Tesla and Microstrategy.

In my EU country people took mortgage loans in CHF. Then CHF pumped against EUR, many people couldn't pay anymore. They sued banks (not much success there), asked government for help.

I‚Äôve had the privilege of witnessing the rise of video games, mobile phones, the internet and now Bitcoin‚Ä¶ I think it is going to be a tumultuous next few decades. Now is when lets go Lol at Joe Biden pretending to attack China

Does Bido own Bitcoin??? So today will be an announcement by Biden which can be summarized with ""We are going to print more USD, LOTS more"".  Which you think would cause people to buy BTC.  But what I am thinking is going to happen is its going to cause people to sell BTC.........which makes absolutely no sense.

Also, \*everyone\* knows he will announce a $6T budget.  It's already known.  So why do people wait until the words leave his lips to start the selloff.  Also makes no sense.

I hope I am wrong.  BTC to the MOON! Friendly reminder: just 5 hours left until ‚ÄúThe Center Of The World And Freedom‚Äù wakes up and dumps what was hard-earned America is awake obviously

cmon America show how it's done, no crypto ban in America men i don't like intrigues, but this thing of Americans waking and selling its catchy and you can even set the hours right in your clock, it's no surprise their living costs is ultra high, it puts pressure on their medium and lower classes, then their culture and mental don't help a bit, since they are wasters, that waste to much and consume to much resources, in europe we use pick-ups and they use literally trucks instead, wasting 3x more fuel to do the same, just an example Idiots keep blaming Americans waking up for the dips...two days ago, it was Americans waking up that stopped the overnight dip and brought it above 40K...then some other countries brought it back below.

However, what's more true is that no countries buy/sell as a group.

Idiots just need to be quiet about blaming other countries Can bitcoin please atleast go to mid 40s?... Cyberhornets unite and buy more bitcoin May 27st Someone really doesn't want BTC to hit 40k...... Nevermind. Beluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuga üê≥ 



HODL don‚Äôt feed the whales Is proof of work better than proof of stake and why? Im so sick of all the shitcoins Europe bought again. Will the US follow suit? I foreshadow a day with thousands of comments Can we let america sleep longer today? Pls. Getting bored? Ok, here is random fact:

Right now, somewhere in China, there is some big speech being preparing right now, about upcoming crypto ban.  
They don‚Äôt want to release it yet because they think our memory cache is 7 days long. BTC yesterday at 40500, we're gonna go to 42k (SIKE), you thought bitch.

BTC today at 39700, we're gonna go to 40k maybe 42k (SIKE AGAIN). Americans waking up in a couple hours see ya at 36k The bear trap is a GO. Aaaand we're going down again.  
\*checks time\*  
Ah.....US waking up. Ameripoors selling to buy bullets, soda, and insulin Carl will buy now. Asia selling troupe to America is waking up soon stuff, this has come full circle. Nice Reminder Bitcoin is supposed to be used as a digital currency, so stop complaining when people sell. Someone knowledgeable please explain why we are not currently in a bull trap. All signs seem to point to this being the case. Can we not apply the same patterns to crypto as we can normal stocks? I want to believe in btc but when you look at the charts everything matches up with this being a textbook bull trap. I was told by some random Joe on Reddit to buy BTC. I am not that stupid. Bull trap! Cryptocurrency sub sucks. So where to discuss what shit could 10x so we can convert them and have more money to buy bitcoin I think the NFT hype is dying now, charity use cases are getting more popular.  Even better if you can receive some passive returns in the process. Shibaken Finance is worth checking out if you‚Äôre into in this, the auto staking benefits are insane Murica about to wake up, time to sell a little I agree, stop buying these fake dips. let it dip to 20k and then we will fill up for good, stop putting dumb money in, ameripoors are selling.

wait for 20k Ppl of the US. When do you tipicaly get your pay checks? Is it every Friday or once a Month? I'm wondering if we can expect more funds on the market soon. Have a good day!

That said, being that I am in possession of a significant amount of the corn, I'm glad the bull trap people are looking like jackasses now. Fomo guys come before mooning someone woke up and chose the color red, as per usual. I'll say it again.

It's gonna be a slog getting to 50k. May take months or even close to a year. Lots of fits and starts.

Once we close above 50k, we will hit 60k within 10 days. I guess America isn‚Äôt feeling like 40k today BTC is heavily manipulated.  Those who bought sub 24K are slowly selling it so they don‚Äôt crash the market. Stop buying these dips. It‚Äôs best to let the price collapse to 20k and get rid of the speculators. Like puking after a bad fish taco, unpleasant at the time but much better afterwards. Proof-of-Work, as it stands, is Bitcoin‚Äôs Achilles heel and is not viable in the long-run. While PoW served a key role as a proof-of-concept, it will soon become inferior to newer systems that will offer better cost, efficiency and performance for the same perceived security and utility. If Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt adapt and adjust, it will be left behind. a 2030 joke...a men with a gun burst into a very large mansion and takes the owner hostage, after a while he founds a safe made of hard metal, he then turns into the owner and asks for the safe combination, the owner answers: ""the password of my computer is my name and age"" Carl will sell now.

That's assuming most of the wealth isn't held by the top 0.1%, which is obviously the wrong assumption. But its a start.

Schnorr signatures will make multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so that an observer is not able to tell if a multi-signature transaction has taken place by viewing transactions on the blockchain.

Schnorr signatures and taproot will enable us to use a protocol called musig2 which enables aggregating public keys and signatures. It will enable point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin payments over the lightning network. It will enable us to use RGB which will allow smart contracts on the lightning network. It will also allow new DLCs and coinswap.

219;"""The Dollar is Hyper-Inflating Against Bitcoin"" - Ross Stevens";nllcgv;5;1622047071.0;jaidancraig;;3;"Bitcoin is a sponge that can soak up all the fiat that they can print. A few things show current inflation quite clear, housing, stockmarkets, groceries, bitcoin etc.

In housing you see back that inflation and on top of that the effects of very low interest rates ( probably even more factors like a shortage etc).

In Bitcoin you see back that inflation and on top of that the effect of price discovery/adoption taking place (and probably more).

 Milton Friedman said, ‚ÄúInflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"".

But how/when we experience the effects of those monetary aspects can be diffused/shifted

The most devastating phase is always a visible lost of trust in the currency.
We have seen it often and even recently some countries have shown it works the same every single time.

Something finally causes people to lose trust, they start spending the currency faster and faster, that ""speed of money"" triggers even more inflation and before it can be stopped the devastating hyperinflation phase sets in.

This has some effects on its own.
Besides the devastating destruction of buying power, some things can show an opposite effect, a store of value, most know is Gold, but it can also be bullets or sigarettes etc, can not only keep their price/buying power but can rise in price/buying power,  that is way higher than the inflation number on its own.

The current fast price increase is not the hyperinflation Dollar.
Average price increase of all goods lack that trend.
That fast price increase is, as mentioned above, mostly its price discovery and better adoption with as offset on that some inflation that all fiat currently show.

The big test is of course going to be the next crisis.

Will Bitcoin indeed behave as a safe haven as gold ?

If hyperinflation sets in will Bitcoin be a hedge against it or even increase faster in value than that inflation number ? There are a lot more things in the world than just dollars and bitcoin. You can compare each against everything else to see what's inflating or not. Looking at just the two alone is a waste of time."
220;Deterministic wallet privacy issue?;nli2hv;1;1622038523.0;JambonBeurreMidi;"From what I know, Deterministic wallets are a set of multiple addresses (usually the 20 firsts generated addresses) controlled by a wallet client that makes it more usable.

You're supposed to never re-use bitcoin addresses.

But if you move funds from a KYC exchange to let's say address 1, and get funds anonymously to address 2.

And you make a big purchase. The deterministic wallet will at the same time withdraw from address 1 and address 2, letting the exchange make a link between address 1 and address 2, which is a privacy issue.

So those wallets shall have ways to tag particular addresses as KYC'd and to exclude them from payments or automatically move funds from KYC'd addresses to a new one in the set of addresses.

Is that how it works and am I right?

Also, when the wallet reaches the 20th address, does it keep going up, or does it go back to address #1, creating other privacy issues?

edit: thank you for the answers, the only privacy issue comes from how the given wallet is made, needs ""coin control""";5;">The deterministic wallet will at the same time withdraw from address 1 and address 2, letting the exchange make a link between address 1 and address 2, which is a privacy issue.

Which is why it is important to use a wallet that allows for coin control.

>Also, when the wallet reaches the 20th address, does it keep going up, or does it go back to address #1, creating other privacy issues?

The wallet will continue to generate new addresses for you to use. has nothing to do with being deterministic. all wallets which combine inputs will have this privacy implication. yes.  the coin control feature was developed in part to help mitigate this issue. obviously nothing can prevent your privacy from being leaked if you need to combine multiple inputs, and one of those inputs has a privacy leak.  well, except you can send 2 separate transactions, thereby injecting a plausibly deniable connection between you and the first input. Coin control will allow you to spend certain utxos so you can prevent that. The wallet continues to create new public receiving addresses No address reuse. Deterministic wallets have millions of addresses. A Bitcoin address is a single-use token. The ""common-input-ownership heuristic"" example you discussed applies to all wallets, not only deterministic wallets. It is discussed in the privacy page

232;Dad got his crypto stolen - You can't protect people from themselves.;nlqha4;395;1622060374.0;Cackling_Crow;"I just need to vent right now. 

I got my dad turned onto Bitcoin and he ended up with a sizeable chunk on coinbase, right? He gets his passwords compromised at least once a year, so being the dutiful son that I am, I buy him a trezor and my wife and I help him set it up. 

He's a little upset that he can't check his balance all the time, but I assure him it's much safer in his trezor that's sitting in his closet safe than it is on coinbase.  

Fast forward to yesterday. I'm on vacation and he calls me asking why his trezor pin doesn't work. He tells me, ""it already had me put in all 24 of those damn passwords, why won't it work?"". 

I told him over and over and over when I set up his trezor and the seed phrase. ""Dad, don't type this in anywhere, don't even take a photo of it"". And what does he do the first time he tries to use his trezor himself?

I am so angry and frustrated right now it's kinda ruining my vacation. You cannot save people from themselves.

EDIT: While I appreciate the ""advice"" of all you crypto aficionados, consider this - dear old dad was supposed to leave the trezor in his safe and not touch it without me. Literally he had an index card with all the Do's, Don'ts, and all that. And sweet lord Satoshi, y'all project/assume a lot.

EDIT2: Reading all the comments, both the empathetic and the weirdly hostile/salty ones, made me feel better about the whole situation. And yeah, my immediate thought as soon as he called me was that I should have kept the seed to myself. Fuck me for trusting my old man to listen to me. Big lesson learned, and not about BTC. 

And since people have asked what exactly happened and to pass that lesson along: Afaik he tried to access his trezor and ended up on a trezor lookalike site that prompted him to put in his recovery seed. I don't know much beyond that right now.";104;"You should have had him install Electrum on his phone, then a watching-only wallet version of his Trezor wallet in Electrum. Then he would have been able to view his balance, transactions, etc. every five minutes, or receive bitcoin, without possibly mucking it up. Don't even need password protection on that watching-only wallet, since you can't spend from it.

At least your dad didn't get nothing for his bitcoin; he paid to learn some valuable lessons. When you custody your bitcoin, you're it. There is no department to direct your complaints or problems to. You're your own bank, which means that you're Chief of Security, too.

This experience would only be a waste if your dad didn't learn from it. > He's a little upset that he can't check his balance all the time

Huh? There are tons of apps and sites that let you track your balance by either just entering the amount of cryptocurrency you own, or by providing wallet addresses. that's terrible. scumbag scam artists. i hope Dad can bounce back from this financial loss. Do the best you can to enjoy the rest of your vacation. at the very least when you are filthy rich, you can let Dad live in one wing of the Castle. I‚Äôm still confused how he lost his crypto? Did he give his password to someone? Sorry for your lost but why did you even give him the seed... If you continue to help with him crypto put that shit somewhere else.

Again sorry for your losses a lot of lessons to be learned here.. like you said you can't save someone from themselves if they don't want to listen That's why I'm actually very careful about recommending cold wallets to people.  For most people, keeping it on Coinbase is safer.  I always lay out the risks of holding on an exchange vs. the risks of self custody. This community has GOT to realize that crypto CANNOT and WILL NOT ever be adopted by the masses while problems like this exist. The average person is dumb. Really dumb. REALLY REALLY dumb. And the average person also has piles of malware on their computer. Telling non-tech-savvy people to manage their own keys is absurd. And shame on ANY of you who do it.

As much as we all hate to admit it.. this MIGHT be the real value proposition for these ""exchanges"" that won't let you move your coin to external wallets. With Paypal, RobinHood, etc... there's literally no way to ""steal"" the Bitcoin.  (Not without selling it, and then leaving a giant paper-trail as you try to move the money out).

I can't believe I'm even saying this out loud.. but.. yup. This may be the niche they should fill. In March of 2014 my father bought 2 BTC based on my recommendation using the last ~$1300 or so he had left after the passing of his mother.  

I sat down with him and explained everything in the simplest terms both my parents could understand after he became irate when mom told me to make sure he understands...

I helped him transfer a tiny bit from Coinbase to his offline wallet (bootable USB Ubuntu distro with wallet) only after verifying he could login to the wallet with his cryptic password.  

Once everything appeared in order, we transferred the remainder. Everything was in order and parents went home...

Fast forward 6 months and BTC and his bootable BTC related USB drive came up in conversation and he had no idea what I was talking about.

I described what the USB key looked like and he finally found it...  He had formatted it because he had no idea what it was.  This is AFTER he threw a hissy fit feeling my mom was being condescending.

The only saving grace was that I had made a secondary backup of his keys unbeknownst to my parents.

I put together a replacement USB which only my mom controls and I also have a copy I keep elsewhere.

My father was 68 at the time this crap happened. You said your dad has passwords compromised many times annually....? BTC aside, perhaps it's time for someone else to manage his finances. 

Tough conversation but there does come a time... That's messed up that you even had the foresight to provide him with physical writeups of all of the dos and don'ts and he still did it. ""And sweet lord Satoshi, y'all project/assume a lot.""

This part had me hollering... I understand going with a Trezor but I just do not get the fear people have with just leaving the money on Coinbase. You can add two-factor and a google authenticator. Unless it was a very large amount, why go through the extra effort? Also knowing he was a newbie and not knowledgeable in the space, why set something up for him that is very complicated?

Should of just left it on coinbase. OP should have encased the trezor in an envelope that had written on it   
""NEVER ENTER THE SEED ANYWHERE""  and then another envelop inside the   
envelope that said ""DO NOT OPEN THIS WITHOUT CONTACTING ME""  Inside   
another envelope that said ""YOUR GOING TO LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY"" Inside   
another envelope that says ""IF you open this and use your trezor without  
 consulting me, consider your BTC GONE!""  inside another envelope that said ""AND its gone!"" and in that envelope would be the trezor

Or maybe have them repeat ""I will never enter the seed anywhere""  like 20 times. and this is why we don't hassle our family to buy bitcoin. you have to want self sovereignty. most people are happy for govt to ""take care"" of them, even it it means being a poor slave. You fucked up trying to teach an old dog new tricks. His money would still be there if you let him watch his balance on coinbase but the‚Äù not your keys‚Äù nonsense went and got dear old boomer daddy fucked over. Were you worried the government was gonna steal his coins? Is he running the Silk Road ? This not your keys shit needs to stop. It‚Äôs 2021, coinbase is a public company , regulated and insured. It‚Äôs not the early 2000s. His coins were safe until u got involved

If anything I woulda showed him how google Authenticator works to protect from the compromised password issue. I don‚Äôt think daddy ever wanted to be his own bank He could have checked his balance with his public adress on any block explorer on his phone with a bookmark.

Don‚Äôt recommend bitcoin to people oblivious to technology. So a person who can't keep a password safe is supposed to be tech savvy enough to be their own bank?

Ultimately you forced him to move his investment from the safe place it was, to a new place where human error was a possibility to lose everything, and even assured him that it would be safer. All while you clearly knew he was prone to human error based on his passwords. 

He is the one that should be venting. If you knew this, you should‚Äôve just managed it for him. Sucks. Risky gadgets. How much did he lose? Some people a tech just aren't compatible. Better watch out when you he starts getting IRS calls from india. That sucks man. I actually bought bitcoin for family members and hold it in my cold wallet for them because I know they won‚Äôt understand the concept and the technology around it. Bitcoin is a continuous learning experience. It‚Äôs always evolving. I used to naively think everyone should try to get off the exchanges and learn to use a hardware wallet. After spending a year subbed to /r/Trezor I've changed my mind. Some people are just too dumb for this. honestly someone that loses theyre passwords as much as you say shouldnt get into crypto. ""can't check his balance all the time""

CoinMarketCap? Electrum read only? Did you mention why he should not expose his seed words?

I know its shitty when people won't seem to listen to you, I bet there's a bit of an I told you so feeling mixed with a what the fuck have we done feeling.

The trezor look-alike site is a pretty common thing, also emails telling you that your coins have been compromised when it hasn't, things like this.

Giving examples of these real world threats gives a lot of context to the warnings, we often forget to give these examples and instead rely on trust in our authority. Especially with family, and with those who often make mistakes, you'd think they'd heed your warnings with a heavy head, but these emails, they are more convincing than you think, and companies, brands, external groups seem to hold a higher authority than they should for many people.

I hope it wasn't everything, and I hope you get through this. He needed to SEE his balance? Jesus Christ, why are some people so OCD? I'm sorry but I just can't feel sorry for people like that. I hate thieves.... intensely. But I kinda hate dumb people even more. This has got to be incredibly frustrating wow...hes hard headed...or it could be dementia.

Now THAT is something to be worried about. classic ""give your corn away, not your corn"" lesson Would of been safer on an exchange :p Boomers should stay with using fiat. It's too late to catch up with tech. Or get him a Fidelity account with blue chip stocks. Electrum watch only wallet would have kept him and your vacation happy!! Use Blue Wallet and XPUB address (read only) so he could monitor his holdings... I‚Äôm sorry this happened to your dad.  Honestly this is why BTC will still have scaling problems.  Longer term the community does need to be able to solve these use cases. I don't know why you would think a hardware wallet would be safer for someone who gets his passwords compromised.

That's the exact situation where Coinbase is actually better than hardware wallets.

You have to go through a lot of loops to actually scam someone out of their Coinbase balance.

Having custody of your own money is only wise for people who knows how to avoid scams and even than many have been scammed still. I feel sorry for your Dad. Wishing you all the best! What was the matter leaving it on cb? They have insurance up in 250k. If he held less than that I wouldn‚Äôt even bother moving. There are countless scams of ledger and Trezor out there. I‚Äôve personally been getting PayPal scam emails in my inbox with yahoo picking it up as a legit PayPal support. I wouldn‚Äôt blam your dad on what happen, but on the companies that are suppose to keep your crypto safe. I think ea trezor or ledger needs their own unique id, unless you set it up as a hot wallet. If cold it should only be access through that device. Expensive lesson but a lesson nevertheless. Next time just manage his account and send him daily screenshots of his balance. Sorry to hear about that! I‚Äôm sure things will be better in some time! For old people I would recommend to use Coinbase Vault. But there is not really a bulletproof security against people who do not understand risks in internet. They spill their passwords or seeds somewhere eventually by using fake websites etc. :( it's your fault , u should bought him a book first ( bitcoin standard ) and learn more about what is it and how it work .and then decide if you are willing to invest in such a thing , 

if you  invest  because  the price is going up , you lose your money  one way or the other  ., Hardware wallets are amazing, but I think for boomers Coinbase or some kinda web wallet would be safer lol. EXODUS.  That's the easy route.  He can also load it on his phone. >  He gets his passwords compromised at least once a year

Okay.

>  I buy him a trezor

Wrong solution. He needed to enable 2FA.

> He's a little upset that he can't check his balance all the time,

Okay.

> I assure him it's much safer 

Wrong solution. A wallet setup with his master pubkey would have likely fulfilled his requirement. he logged onto one of those fake trezor sites. Sorry to hear what happened, that sucks. How did his cb pw get compromised so often? By any chance, you dad doesn't work with oil pipelines does he? Is he retarded? Honest question. My friend had his email hacked and they somehow emptied his coinbase acct even with 2fa! He never got a text, so they were able to use his email instead of a text I guess? It's been over 2 weeks since his acct was locked and he had no idea if anything is in it anymore! lol! Wasn't it very very very predictable? I mean come on! You cannot seriously think that it's a good idea for people to be their own bank?! Especially non tech-savvy people. Are you that blind?! The chances are very high that something terrible happen over the years. The beauty of irreversible transactions! 

It's retarded as f*ck! May your dad be wiser than you and never touch cryptos again. Trezor + windows is not safe. And by not giving him a read only monitoring setup, you basically teased him into trying to do it without you. You can't fix stupid. Unfortunately, your Dad is thick. This is the part where you turn to the darkside. So how did he get hacked originally ?  Like how did he go to a site to display the passowrd ?  how much did he lose ? So... What exactly did your dad do? I get the feeling this was an inside job Or even Blockfolio.... Focus on your vacation. Have man to man conversion and deal with it. Yes, this is a rough arena. Internet bullies abound. Can't you check your trezor balance without actually plugging in the device?

I thought there was an option to check to remember your PC or something. old people and tech never works out.

probably should have set up a portfolio on coinmarketcap so he could look at the numbers go up and down. > You can't protect people from themselves

And yet, governments around the world waste trillions of dollars trying... I learned really quick if you start steering away from what's working and try to move them somewhere safe it's so easy to have them compromised. I just got hacked myself. It's kind of sad how easy it is to get taken and nothing you can do about it. Education and research is key. Everyone has there own way though. That sucks. Hard lesson learned. How did the scam play out? Can you elaborate so people can watch out themselves? As much as it is hard to accept, crypto is not for everyone. It requires a lot of attention to detail and some technical skills and discipline.

Some people, especially the older gen and non tech savvy people, may be better off to have bank managing their finance. That sucks man  but the old man has to learn the hard way sometimes. You should show him how to move coins into and out of storage This is 100% your fault; why would you get your tech illiterate, easily hacked father into a currency rife with irreversible scams? That sucks, man. Don‚Äôt go to hard on him tho, when you‚Äôre his age you‚Äôre gonna have a hard time as well with new tech. Hope he learns from this and is open to let you have more control over this stuff. My mom‚Äôs also always doing crazy shit like that lol. Good luck and I hope it wasn‚Äôt that much money.. I feel for you man. I can't tell my dad shit either. We'll probably be the same with our kids someday if that makes you feel any better. 

Good luck Ledger :) balance on app I know this is how it has to be but it just seems so complicated with all the special words and trezors and wallets and hard wallets and vaults and why can‚Äôt you just leave it on Coinbase and scam Elkins trying to take your coin.  If blockchain isn‚Äôt so secure why can‚Äôt the freaking coin be secure. Sorry to here it. Sounds like you did everything you could. Ouch Or you stole them.... sheeesh Dad's into porn People often forget than being your own bank also requires for you to be your own physical security guard and tech security.

That's why most opt to give custody of their money. That's why you set up a passphrase as well Okay so judging by the multitude of these posts , I think I‚Äôll take my luck just leaving my coins on a site , as it seems you‚Äôre ore likely to be duped this way then a big site needing hacked You can also just search the Xpub on blockchain.info, and then add the URL to your favorites. This is exactly why I‚Äôve always thought final transactions are a bad thing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs simply just bad for the majority of people. You accidentally reveal your private key to someone and poof, account drained‚Ä¶ at least with by debit card and credit cards I have SOME recourse‚Ä¶. But not in this case. 

I‚Äôm so sorry. That is terrible. I don‚Äôt know how to help and there‚Äôs probably isn‚Äôt shit any of us can do except say we are sorry‚Ä¶ maybe one day there will be a service in crypto which will help people when their coins get lost or stolen‚Ä¶ you did everything you could OP, don¬¥t blame yourself.

maybe it would be possible for YOU to hold a little bit for your day. This is why I think people who aren't very technical would be better of leaving their stuff on Coinbase or some other exchange. If you don't understand the technology, it's a bad idea being your own bank. Safepal app allows you to track the coins on your wallet This is why not everyone can be their own bank. Bitcoin tracker on android just tell it how much you have and it tells you the balance. Crypto has a UX problem.  


The vast majority of people really shouldn't be in charge of handling large sums of money without guardrails. I'm sorry to hear that... Next time, try taking the words of his seed away so he can't use them and get scammed. We need to protect our dads haha

Or better, write the seed yourself but change a word. Instead of ""despair"", for example, write down ""airdesp"" in cursive or so. He won't notice the word is false and doesn't give a proper seed and you will know it and be able to write the word properly if you need to recover his wallet! The excessive insistence on hardware cold wallets in this sub, even for newbies still trying to understand how it all works, is honestly annoying. You should've just helped him setup a good mobile wallet for now. And like others said, many can be linked to hardware wallets as well so you could atleast combine the cold wallet with the accessible interface. Cold wallets only are good if you're an experienced holder who already accumulated a large balance and have no plans of touching it for years. Mistakes happen. I use ledger and they have a nice ui for watching your portfolio while it sits safely on the wallet. Hopefully you guys didn‚Äôt lose too much! How were they stolen? Idiot dad Sounds like you need to get him a 1passowrd or lastpass too. I honestly don't know how the hell I got by without a password manager for so many years. For chrissakes people the guys just fucking venting and everybody‚Äôs like could‚Äôve should‚Äôve would‚Äôve leave the fucking guy alone. Be nice to your Dad you will miss him when hes gone I can assure you. Trust me I know. My Dad was like yours and I would give anything to be able to speak to him about anything. Remember he will be feeling bad, humiliated a fool etc, be supportive of him. Don't sweat it, my dad's the same way. Never trust the older generation with technology, do everything for them and don't let them get their hands on it. They'll fuck it up every time no matter what. That SUUUUCKS and is so freaking frustrating. Ugh.

I'm assuming you've already tried loading up a new wallet with the seed to move coins off JUUUST in case the scammers haven't already? Anytime I read a post like this, the OP makes a huge error. If your dad is anything like my dad (+60), the fault is all on your own. Managing hard wallet is not for boomers... \>He's a little upset that he can't check his balance all the time  


Uhh, you didn't consider pointing him out to like, coindesk or maybe coinmarketcap? Lmao. It's not like the BTC amount changes once it's in the trezor. I buy my family members crypto and just leave it on their coinbase accounts with verification password requirements. Feel this is the safest thing to do especially for those non-tech-savvy coin owners."
233;Government intervention;nllje2;4;1622047562.0;thunderlips_1;"I'm not saying this is going to happen or attempting to spread FUD. I simply wanted to start a discussion on how a government could take down Bitcoin if they wanted to. Hypothetical discussion. Looking for your ideas and/or criticisms of mine.

I can think of two ways a government could enforce a ban or simply restrict crypto.

1) Mandate Apple, Google and Microsoft to remove all crypto apps from their stores.

2) Mandate internet providers to restrict access to crypto services (here in Canada there's like 3 major providers which are federally regulated).

Any thoughts?";12;"None of those. They will prevent banks from sending or receiving funds from crypto. There are work arounds to the two issues you mentioned.  As for crypto apps there are plenty of exchanges that do not operate by app. As for ISP restrictions, people could very well use a VPN service to access exchanges.

How the general public would react to a ban as well as institutions is another story how ever. 

Kudos for bringing up this topic. I think it will be a valuable, and healthy discussion. Also consider BISQ exchange and the way that they operate.  I believe BTC would survive government intervention. My thoughts?  
The old fiat fatties be like: We NeEd LaWs sO we DOn'T loSE!1""!  
Bitcoin: [lul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKNoU2P0dQc) I guess they could tax it into oblivion.  Make all crypto transactions taxable at a 40% rate.  Then publicize the apprehension of a few hundred non-compliant tax evaders getting thrown into jail. They cant because itll encourage an explosion in the black market.

As long as ‚Äúbad actors‚Äù exist, bitcoin will have value. There is an option: governments have almost unlimited funds. They can simply flood the network with transactions and pay extremely high fees for those transactions. The network gets almost unusable then. BUT: they have to continue this attack for an infinite time and they have to do it on all coins, not just bitcoin. Otherwise people will simply switch to networks that are not under attack. [removed] That is a good point to discuss and estimulate our creativity:) Idk how, but I know what they gonna use, as always, they'll using the using the force against innocent people. Governments don‚Äôt want to prohibit BTC they want to control and regulate BTC, and any other crypto coin.  The public ledger and ability to follow the money is the ideal way for complete control through digital currency. Let‚Äôs not discuss this on Reddit where it will undoubtedly be analyzed at some point should a government pursue this path"

235;2.67 btc stollen from Trezor T;nkqwdx;84;1621952496.0;lrmpeixoto;"Recently I bought a Trezor T hardware wallet trough an official Brazilian reseller (KriptoBR). The wallet arrived last week (Friday) and I promptly used to configure the Wallet in the official website ([Trezor.io/start](https://Trezor.io/start)), including seed words and passcode. I'm an enthusiast of bitcoin since 2017 and from there I've been accumulating bitcoin on [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) and paperwallets (the hold amount) and Binance (the amount that I use for trading). After withdrawing almost all my balance from the paperwallets, Binance and [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) to my Trezor, on Saturday and Sunday (total 2.67 bitcoins), I entered again on [Trezor.io](https://Trezor.io) website (witch was on my favorite websites, as recommended) to check if the transaction was concluded. I don't know what happened at that moment, but, my chrome browser used to open several new tabs every website I tried to navigate. After opening [trezor.io](https://trezor.io) official website, I'm not sure, but maybe some of these phishing tabs have opened and I didn't realize. And why do I say that? Because this morning I tried to access again [Trezor.io](https://Trezor.io) website and the multiple tabs continued opening on my Chrome browser. The website that opened is very similar to the original one, including the standard padlock besides the address and the Trezor official logo, except for one difference: the address, that is [https://trezor.io-checkrestore.com/wallet.html](https://trezor.io-checkrestore.com/wallet.html) (but I realized that only this morning!). The fact is that, an identical Trezor website asked my seed words indicating that a recovery was necessary, and as a newbie in hard wallets, I put the seed words on the website. Yesterday when I tried to check my balance trough xPub address, the Trezor balance was ZERO. When checking the transactions history, as you can see in the prints, ALL MY FUNDS were drained to this address ""13818Kr5DYwQj1Hzxx6sG328GJkR2QPFEM"", and, to my surprise, when I checked the address balance, I realized the robbers has stolen other people trough the same way ... I'm completely devastated. I'm writing this post to alert other users to not fall for similar scams. From now, I will start again try to buy and hold bitcoins, but no more on a Trezor wallet. I really don't know where to send my coins, that sucks! In my opinion, Trezor should have a smartest way to access the wallet, for example, a computer application, not a website that anyone can clone! Bellow I put some photos comproving what I'm saying. And posteriorly I will try to record the screen when that happens again, because I don't happen every time, but only sporadicaly.

[The real website](https://preview.redd.it/208w513vz9171.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f92f945f56a2271c7f216aeac30f9db48fbe8c8)

Don‚Äôt need to read further. The only time you should ever enter your seed is in catastrophe situations when you the hard wallet is destroyed/confirmed lost forever. You should never enter your seed anywhere, and Trezor mentions this multiple times in the set up. Really sorry this happened to you bro but thi s is like btc cardinal sin #1. Also why are there ""multiple tabs opening when you try to navigate a website""? This obviously should not happen and it sounds like that machine has/had other malware on it in the first place. I recommend not using that machine with anything crypto related, at least until you do a clean sweep with a quality malware protection program to clear it. Good luck man. > I will start again try to buy and hold bitcoins, but no more on a Trezor wallet

If *that* is the lesson you learned from this then you are just going to lose your coins again. >Trezor should have a smartest way to access the wallet, for example, a computer application, not a website that anyone can clone!

they have exactly that, it's called trezor suite It was never stolen from you Trezor hardwallet. It never made it there. You were scammed and unfortunately you fell for it. Your screenshots show very obvious red flags. Sorry for you loss. Didn't the guide tell you to NOT input seed anywhere?

Sorry for your loss :( TL;DR:

> The fact is that, an identical Trezor website asked my seed words indicating that a recovery was necessary, and as a newbie in hard wallets, I put the seed words on the website.

Trezor has NOTHING to do with having lost the coins. the funds were not stolen from your Trezor. You used an infected PC to setup and access your wallet and you did not read the note warning about entering your seed anywhere online. 

sorry, but this is not Trezor's fault, but your own for not keeping your PC safe. This isn‚Äôt Trezors fault. This is your fault. The wallet did exactly what it was designed to do, it protected your key from the malware on your computer until you foolishly typed it in.


You are told multiple times never to input your seed into anything besides your wallet and even then be very careful.


Your computer has malware and you fell for a phish. You said yourself it opened multiple tabs when you were navigating.


Edit: Trezor does have an official desktop app that you can use instead of the website btw. You didn‚Äôt do any research before learning how to custody your coins.

https://suite.trezor.io/


Edit2: You should file a police report btw. 2.67 BTC is not chump change, thats ~$100,000 Holy shit dude, you got scammed so hard. One of the most BASIC fundamentals of storing your crypto is NEVER sharing your key phrase. On one hand I feel a pit in my stomach for you but on the other I can't help but thank god I'm not that stupid and did my own research before doing anything. OP is either a troll or he did something incredibly stupid.  I could go either way with that.

I honestly don't have the faintest fucking idea how someone can be an ""enthusiast of Bitcoin since 2017"" and not understand basic security processes. The only purpose of a hardware wallet is to not have  your seed going though a computer. That's why your seeds are presented on the device and you're told explicitly to not type it, just write it with your hands in the piece of paper they provide. I just can't understand how people that are in crypto for so long and get to the point of buying a Trezor fall for basic stuff like this. Also, never buy a hardware wallet from a reseller, use the official web site, buy it from there and get it sent to you thought UPS. You either get it cheaper or/and safer than buying fro ma reseller. The OP has had his reddit account for 0 days. Whenever I see these types of posts (there are many) of people claiming to get scammed by coinbase, ledger, or trezor, they tend to be the scammers themselves when their reddit account has literally just been created. I am assuming they try and phish from people in the comments or people click on their shitty scam URL's they post. 

OP is lying. This guy wasn't scammed he is the scammer. Not even remotely Trezor‚Äôs fault. Don‚Äôt word posts like this and spread misinformation. I‚Äôm sorry you lost your bitcoin, but I‚Äôm annoyed by the angle you took, especially since you didn‚Äôt even notice the insane URL and didn‚Äôt know about not entering your seed phrase ever. If you don‚Äôt know the cardinal rules, it‚Äôs on you, not on Trezor which is a fantastic company with excellent products that goes to every possible length to save people like you from themselves. Can you remove the link from the phish website... We don't want google's crawler to think it's a good site by linking to it.

You obviously know this now, but never ever input your seed anywhere but on the device...

> but no more on a Trezor wallet

It's not even Trezor's fault, you input your seed on a fucking website...

> Trezor should have a smartest way to access the wallet

It is, but they can't protect you against your own stupidity. trezor.io/suite

It's not Trezor's fault you got victim of a phishing attack, could have been happened with every other wallet as well. 

Sorry for your loss. 

Work on your OPSEC. > The fact is that, an identical Trezor website asked my seed words indicating that a recovery was necessary, and as a newbie in hard wallets, I put the seed words on the website.  
  
There should have been warnings all over the contents of your box. Right on the pamphlet that was supplied with my Trezor are the words, in bold, ""**Never enter your seed on websites or apps, these are common scams and you risk losing your funds.**"". It's right there in black and white, not to do the very thing you did. I don't know why people don't take that warning very seriously. You shouldn‚Äôt insert your keys or phrase any where, it‚Äôs only meant for you. All I have to add besides the other comments, Trezor T is probably the most secure cold wallet out there. Even more than Ledgers. In your case, you made a mistake.  You should be extremely careful using any types of wallets where you haven't fully verified the end user along with how an exchange is occurring (computer, exchange, hardware, etc).  I'll be blunt: you should RARELY use a hardware wallet.  Good for long term savings, not much else.

As for hardware wallets, hackers are coming - [some vulnerabilities have been found and more will be found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHZmg48sD7Y).  As one of my buddies says who studies this vulnerabilities, for every defense, there's a counter-attack. Everyone wants to be a btc maximalist and fuck banks. Remember: with great power comes great responsibility If you send 2.67 BTC to an Elon Musk scam site you will probably hold Tesla accountable and never buy a Tesla again.

It is a pity that despite this tragic loss you still do not understand and blame the wrong one, thereby **you are damaging an innocent**! Therefore, clearly no sorry! With this attitude you will fall for more scams to come and have deserved no better. It sounds like your Chrome browser was compromised to me. That could be via plugins that send your copy clipboard content to the attackers or something like that

14 BTC they have stolen. They are an absolutely bunch of wankers

I can't help you restore anything but I can say that in the future, try and use an isolated OS for doing transactions, such as a trusted virtual machine ISO that is used solely for transaction purposes and not anything else

Edit - Just re-read your OP thoroughly. Yes, you were not visiting the official Trezor website. That is almost certainly the source of the attack If you fall for a scam phishing web site and are stupid enough to enter your seed code and passphrase online into a browser (no matter what website!), you have failed to understand the basic concept of a hardware wallet.

Worst of all, you now blame Trezor for your own stupidity!!! So you blame Trezor for not controlling the entire Internet and preventing anyone to generate a phishing site.

This is not only stupid, it is malvolent, because you blame Trezor for something that is not their fault AT ALL.

As such, I can really say, if anybody has deserved to fall for the scam, you have. Nobody wants to admit it, but this is one of the biggest barriers to crypto adoption.  


The vast majority of people are not capable of or do not want to be their own bank. Until big players come out with cheap custodial wallets with full liability insurance for their holdings, it will always be hard for people to justify using a hardware wallet and being responsible for huge sums of money, with little to no recourse in the face of theft.  


Even with the crypto in my RH I'm slightly worried about theft, but I would never ever want to risk using a hardware wallet where I am solely responsible for the safe keeping of anything over a few hundred dollars. Come on people don‚Äôt be dicks, this guys already feels like shit without all the shaming and blaming https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/e1a9o1/fake\_trezor\_website\_all\_funds\_lost/ Trezor does have an application you can use locally :/ this is painful to read. from the buying part til the end. I tried to report the fraudulent domain to AlibabaCloud (who seems to be hosting it) but their reporting page is a PITA, requiring a ""proof document"" (I copied and pasted your post into a .doc and uploaded that) as well as a ""identity proof"" document (I'm not giving alibaba a copy of my drivers license kthx) so all I did was re-upload your post in .doc form for that. Hopefully someone will take a look at it anyway but I doubt it. Maybe if someone who has more faith in Alibaba will try and get through to them and eventually they'll take it down, but surely it'll just get re-hosted somewhere else. And so the game goes on....

&#x200B;

Sorry for your loss, but in the end it hopefully made you smarter. Expensive price to pay for such a cheap lesson. Never type your seed into any computer. The  point of a hardware wallet is the seed is never on any computer. Ouch. 

A few transactions ago they send their coins to this address 1K59oFmr8PQq2oX8n25qT5zwUh3AL73Mn5 and then a large chunk from that address was sent to 1ZBuhhC4pByop2vFZk4Tn1cq1GwJps1oC which is the exchange Huobi. It's likely 1K59oFmr8PQq2oX8n25qT5zwUh3AL73Mn5  was a deposit address on Huobi which is a large Hong Kong crypto exchange. 

The website you posted was also registered on a Hong Kong domain registration website. 

I'm not sure were you are located, you may be able to contact Huobi esp with a police report in hand. If they deposit your coins, you may be able to get them back.

Yes you fell for this, but we need fewer scammers in the world. This is disheartening :/ I'm sorry for your loss.  

I'm wishing you a swift financial and emotional recovery. Life goes on and it will have many more bright moments for you in store :) All the best!  

> I will start again try to buy and hold bitcoins, but no more on a Trezor wallet.  

Trezor wallet is ok. It sucks that the user is usually the weakest link here. There are no wallets that can really prevent user errors. You can mitigate things like that by vigilance and using a non-website wallet interface (so a software that runs locally on your computer), like Electrum or Specter, which both allow to connect a hardware wallet to it (be it Trezor or another popular hardware wallet). Of course, you need to pay lots of attention where you download it from, as there are phishing attempts there, too.   

Ideally, it also should be connected to your own full node but take it all step by step. I know the OP personally and I vouch for his narrative. Deeply sorry for his loss. Thanks for sharing this as a warning. OP,

I am terribly sorry for the lost money and I am terribly sorry for the attitude of some of the posters here. You deserve better. I know that there are no words I can offer you to make this better. It is a truly horrible thing that has happened to you.

&#x200B;

Trezor wallet does have some interface related problems. I recommend using SafePal/Ledger. Both of their interfaces are application instead of web based. They are much more intuitive and easy to use.

  
Please ignore all of the rude comments. Sending love. <3 We should all try to put fake seed words the first time we enter them anywhere and check is the system falls for it, that way we know it's a scam. I know that probable some sites are automatic but my net would be that not all of them are. Even if it works just once to save 2.67btc it will be worthwhile Trezor does have a computer app. Trezor suite. for the future: if your computer suddenly starts opening tabs on it's own, the *only* thing you should do with it is instantly wipe it's drives and reinstall everything. and maybe this time stay away from shady sites and weird browser plugins. 

Guess it was an expensive lesson, but an important one. OP please remove the hyperlink to the scam site otherwise a google webcrawler will add it as +1 to the sites relatively score for bitcoin searches. Practice good opsec.

&#x200B;

>my chrome browser used to open several new tabs every website I tried to navigate.

Your computer behaved in a way that should of told you something was off about the site. I mean you even looked that the phishing URL had the Secure lock icon, but you woudnt be bothered to look at that long URL? Go scan your computer for malware and stop blaming Trezor for the coins you lost.

&#x200B;

>as a newbie in hard wallets

FTFY oof size: EXTRA LARGE Install some malware scanner like malwarebytes before doing anything else on your computer Didnt have to read past the first sentence to realize how you fucked up.

Abra√ßo Hey OP, sorry for your loss but you have to read the manual man... So you used windows, got redirected to a malware site, and gave them your seed words.

Dont use windows in the future. And never type your seed words into anything. I‚Äôm not üíØ sure I understand the concept reseller, you mean this was like a second hand device? Sorry for your loss. To anyone else: If you're a newbie in hardware wallets it's better to leave most of your crypto on reputable exchanges. Do extensive research to understand all the risks and how to portect your seed and all the in and outs. Then slowly start transfering funds and play around with it to understand how it works. Only then consider putting a substantial amount of your funds on hardware wallet. I'm very sorry for your loss, you seem to be an experienced user (has paper wallet, has different wallets and accounts on exchanges) and have been around for a few years. Unfortunately your heart has in the right place (making your coins safer) but even that doesn't seem to have been enough to prevent that tragic outcome. That seems like a sophisticated scam, of course you had a few red flags along the way, but I don't think that puts anybody in here in a position to judge.

I'm very sorry you lost the majority of your investment and wish you all the best in rebuilding that fortune even bigger.

Trezor reseller?  That never ends well. First of all let me say I am very sorry you lost your bitcoin, that sucks and is awful. You must learn the correct lesson, it is extremely costly lesson but if you are blaming Trezor than you lost all that coin and haven't learned anything. You failed to follow instructions, had you read all the papers, and paid attention to the warnings you would have known that putting your seed words on any website was wrong. I hope you follow the directions the next time 10000 dollars worth of bitcoin is on the line, good luck, I hope that, in time, you get back all the sats you lost and then some! I'm really sorry this happened, but I want to thank you for posting this.  Someone will learn something from this. I have.  Again.... I'm really sorry, bud. So sad... That‚Äôs why you bookmark the actual website Can OP sue the company? Having read this again, it seems incredibly unlikely to be true. Who puts $100k into something with literally less than 5 minutes of research? OP ends by complaining Trezor hasn't made a desktop app when they very clearly have, it's obvious on their website.

And what's with the ""friend"" in the comments verifying OP's story? Since when do people do that use a coldcard next time, sorry for your loss. Also should have set up a hidden wallet for that amount, if not multiple ""The fact is that, an identical Trezor website asked my seed words indicating that a recovery was necessary, and as a newbie in hard wallets, I put the seed words on the website.""

&#x200B;

Yeah I was looking for those words. > my chrome browser used to open several new tabs every website I tried to navigate

You kept using this browser?

You entered seed words into an internet connected machine? On a dodgy website? Why cant people  just use an offline  TAILS OS  which has electrum in it?

Instead of buying any thing from anywhere to generate seed. I hope you win more than your lost. Boa sorte. Here's the tl;dr:

> I put the seed words on the website.

PSA: You shouldn't even be putting your seed words in an *official* Trezor website. It's not the validity of the specific website that's the issue, it's that you were even online at all while typing seed words. Check your chrome extensions.  It could be in there.  Probably something you gave permission to read every website you visit which allows it to know you are visiting trezor.io . Binance : You didn't trust me , didn't you... > I will start again try to buy and hold bitcoins, but no more on a Trezor wallet.

op is a dumbass, more at 11.

Did you know ""gullible"" is written on the ceiling? Sorry for your loss.

Never enter the seed into a computer.

Train transfers first with small amounts repeatedly until you're sure you know what you're doing.

You can use Electrum (standalone app) on your computer with many hardware wallets including trezor. I have alerted the Chinese registrar where the scammer's site is registered asking them to remove the site. What surprises me is that Ledger and Trezor do not act immediately and remove these sites right away. Lmao Sounds like PICNIC to me Fuck man...I am sorry to hear that. This is fucked up. newbies should only get coldcard only fool proof hardware wallet I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. 
I recommend you to format and reinstall the Operation system. It‚Äôs seems that your computer has been affected by a malware (Chrome opening tabs automatically). As the others users said, never put/write your seed into a computer connected to internet. In additional I‚Äôd like to recommend you that when dealing with cryptos, to use linux  instead of Windows. Linux is more secure than windows for this purpose. 
Note: No Hardware wallet will be safe for you, if you don‚Äôt follow the guides on how to keep you seed safe ""trough an official Brazilian reseller""

 I know people are free to switch mining pools but what if Elon or someone like him (who has a positive image and comes off as benign for most  media / people) manages to convince a lot of miners to march under a single banner.

I assume this conversation has already taken place and has been discussed to death but I can't find any resources, if anyone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it.

Thanks for reading my post";7;"A lot of the security, from what I understand, comes from the fact that it‚Äôs not profitable to attack. 

The game theory idea that people ‚Äústeal‚Äù to gain wealth, if applied here, points to a non factor as the bad actors would be out the resources AND destroy any value they or those they know invested in btc. 

This is VERY sophomoric in scope but valid. I am seriously worried about this imbecile trying to pose as a father of crypto or some shit.

He should smoke some more mary and leave us the fuck alone.

Maybe get investigated finally. any miner can reject any transaction. and some do.  there are some banned addresses out there. i would never respect such a list, but miners are free to.  but 90% of miners could reject a transaction, but the transaction would still go through eventually. it just might take longer. blocks are random. and there are far too many miners to get them to 100% agree to anything at all. I just recently saw a video about this topic. Many assume miners have all the power, but in reality everyone has the same power. Look for yourself: https://youtu.be/rpeceXY1QBM States can and probably will subsidize miners who only include transactions from whitelisted addresses which provides enough incentive for them to do so. How much of a threat this will be is an open question and I don't personally think this will result in more than creating a two (or more since different states will have different whitelists) tier system of base layer transaction in terms of average cost. This will ultimately be unsustainable for states to keep up and will die out eventually.

In addition, there are concerns that this recent phony environmental concern trolling over electricity costs of mining will create a two tier system of newly minted coins into ""green"" and ""dirty"" coins. The implications of which are unclear and I hope will be a topic of debate at the upcoming Bitcoin conference in Miami. Until then, this article was quite interesting:

Nodes don't have voting. There's no majority. That's why it's called ""consensus"". Invalid blocks are not propagated by any node which applies the rules Due to game theory it‚Äôs unlikely miners would act against their own interests to attack the network since this would cripple confidence in security reducing value. But a 51% attack is a potential vulnerability‚Ä¶"

Almost all the youtubers  with  Crypto news or TA content have a history less than a year. None of them goes back to 2017. Some admitted  at some point in their videos that they were in the market during the last bull cycle and making videos.  That made me think they might have been potentially selling false hope back in last bull cycyle just to keep retail investors in the market. The ones that make 'next 100x coin"" are full of shit thats for sure. I just wanna find out if the whole community is somewhat the same.

The sooner you get that in your head the better. Also, people that are trying to time the market AKA traders, generally all lose in the long run. Almost everybody that's crypto Rich today has been holding since 2017 or earlier and hasn't traded. Let's say somebody can predict the future and made ~~millions~~ billions off trading Bitcoin or whatever. Would this person

A) stay quiet, concentrate on the TA and enjoy the earnings?

OR

B) go out of their comfort zone, start making videos on YT, manage sponsors, get pennies from Google adverts, beg for likes and follows, manage other social accounts to drive the traffic to YT and give up their privacy completely? It's common for youtubers to delete their history to hide their bad predictions. TA isn't worth a shit in Crypto. The only thing these videos might do is help with hype. Anyone who did lots of price predictions and TA, yeah. The you tubers focused on fundamentals, tech, etc. those haven‚Äôt changed at all. Check out Benjamin Cowen, he is a straight shooter. Just watch one of their recent videos to see that they are full of shit. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but the whole crypto influencer was birthed from the 2017 rise. Maybe not birthed but at the very least has become more widespread. I would guess the reason you don‚Äôt see history that far back is because they didn‚Äôt see the opportunity until this time around. Look at nodeInvestor and Cryptobud I followed both of them since 2017 they been right a lot. It can be multiple factors that might be playing a role. Youtube has been ramping up the censorship lately pretty hard. And theyre also cracking down on copyrighted material as of late. You now require to indentify yourself for videos marked for adults. Alot of videos were getting copyright striked, and some channels even got demonetized completely for too much copyright material.  

So if the videos you're talking about had any form of copyrighted material in it, it could be for that reason that its been taken down or unlisted.

Ive uploaded videos myself(on a total different subject), in 2019 the audio used would be non copyright, but in 2021 the audio is considered as copyrighted audio. 

But some could also just be trying to hide their previous predictions. If hedge funds that hire the smartest people on the planet with their advanced modeling and massive data sets can't consistently predict where markets go, do you think some random youtuber is going to have a chance?"

249;The energy narrative is looking more and more like a power play against Bitcoin;nks4jm;610;1621955721.0;IllVagrant;"Imagine if someone measured the amount of energy everyone on the planet used to surf reddit then equated that with the amount of pollution generated by energy companies in order to service that habit; then decided that it's the users of reddit who are at fault for that pollution. That's the argument being used against bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining today.

Now Micheal Saylor and Elon Musk are showing support for the creation of a 'council' to regulate the energy usage around crypto mining. Before thinking this is a good idea, keep in mind that imposing licensing who can and cannot mine to secure a system no one owns, was built to be decentralized and placed into the hands of everyone, and allows people to earn money with minimal upfront investment and almost no labor, completely undermines all of the benefits of such a system and makes the network more vulnerable to manipulation by private interests. All of this backed on the pretense of a study that was not peer-reviewed and relies on poor logic that would otherwise point the finger at energy producers for the creation of pollution, not users.

So, it seems that this may have been a ploy to centralize authority over the cryptocurrency by billionaires all along. As to whether they can convince people that this council needs to exist and can enforce who can and cannot participate, it remains to be seen. But don't think for a second any of this was about saving the planet, it was always about money and maintaining control over it.

What happens if this narrative successfully convinces the population at large that mining ought to be licensed and those licenses are priced way above the heads of any typical user? This is a tried and true method of how private cartels have already exhorted control in other industries for centuries past.

The entire point of bitcoin was to dis-empower oligarchy in the wake of occupy wallstreet. The only way bitcoin fails in this task is if its participants allow it to fail.";76;"[quality twitter thread on this issue from a bitcoin miner](https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1397258946277122048) Of course. This is the new government playbook now whenever they want to vilify anything.

‚ÄúBitcoin is so bad for the environment it **cannot** be allowed to succeed.‚Äù They cannot stop it by force and are trying whatever they can to slander it and see what sticks.

Where was all this environmental concern over gold mining, legacy financial institutions, beef farming etc.? 


Nowhere, because the government was lining their pockets and thats what really matters. Bitcoin is antifragile. It will absorb this stupidity and still thrive. Yes. They will continuously attack bitcoin from every angle to try to take it over. Our job to fight back. We are what makes it anti fragile. We the people. They're trying to solve a problem which does not actually exist. the 1% want 51% This guy gets it.

I heard ""ololol it's just a friendly get together calm your tits Elon deserves your respect"" a bunch of times on Twitter, but this might be the terminal end of decentralization in the not too distant future, greenwashed and state sanctioned.

Green crypto = super duper awesome.

Councils, closed door meetings, cartels? Fuck right off. Smart point. Centralization is the only weapon they have. Bcash was one attempt and thankfully that failed. This could very well be another attack

Being led by Elon is also no surprise. He could get in big trouble with the SEC for his twitter shenanigans. He is also beholden to the US for clearances to build his rockets. They have leverage on him and he is probably being coerced. I think Saylor is trying to give baby Elon a bottle so it stops crying. Answer this, Do you think Tesla selling all these cars are being charged with Renewable energy ?

Do u think Musk doesnt know this ?

We all know the answer. He wont stop selling Tesla even if those cars are charged at home via non-renewanle energy. Yup another attack under different pretenses Michael Saylor is just trying to be proactive, which is smart.  People consuming electricity should be proactive before people jump in and start regulating.  A council is nothing more than that.  A think tank.  A means for dialogue and discourse.  It is 100% in the best interest of bitcoin miners to use the cheapest electricity available.  So this doesn't really derail anything.  Sometimes the cheapest form available is coal.  That doesn't mean the miners are at fault anymore than the guy surfing reddit using ""coal"" is at fault.  It means there are decisions to be made by their governments and regulators to better the situation.  Not down with the vilification of Saylor, he is one of the white knights for us, he only wants BTC to go up and has no ulterior motive.  Elon may in fact have a different motive as he is intertwined into a complex web of governments, renewable energy and the desire to make shit tons of money.. The energy spent for mining a Bitcoin gives it value IMO. It‚Äôs an asset that required both effort and cost for the miner. 
There are other things much more energy consuming and polluting than Bitcoin. > support for the creation of a 'council' to regulate the energy usage ... licensing ... centralize authority

Not at all what is being proposed.

Regulation of energy usage is entirely different to reporting of energy composition.

It's more a move to head-off such regulation rather than to impose it. exactly, this is everything bitcoin stands against. ""This sentence may seem innocuous at face value, but it sets the stage for social pressure that will lead to regulatory pressure that will lead to the subsidizing of certain energy mixes over others, which will inevitably lead to a massive misallocation of capital throughout the mining industry and potentially end in a scenario where this council attempts to bifurcate the network by selling ""green"" bitcoins at a premium over ""dirty fossil fuel"" bitcoins.""

https://tftc.io/martys-bent/issue-998/ Lol. What gave it away? The fact that they did this with the internet, and the electric car? Or perhaps that they only reference bitcoins consumption and nothing else? Or that every other anti bitcoin argument has been incorrect? This was my first thought when reading yesterday‚Äôs tweet. It definitely appears to be an attempt to centralize and control bitcoin. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. I think bitcoin will survive this, but it‚Äôs a set back in the short term. But what about fishing!?!? 100%. Have they also not thought of the fact that the two biggest cryptocurrencies are capped and once those caps are reached, the energy consumption will drop off a cliff. But mining precious minerals, say lithium for electric car batteries, or gold for who knows why anymore because it does not back my American dollars, will forever balloon. What say you now Musklor? Of all the weird narratives, the energy one is the dumbest one. 

It's like, I'm sure Kevin O Leary is conserving the light bulbs and checking to see that all his private jet fuels is Greek energy. It has been clear to me for some time the there is concerted propaganda campaign being waged against Bitcoin with regard to its power usage. When someone brings it up I usually ask them how much power they think Bitcoin uses as percentage of global consumption. It's about 0.66%. While this is a very large amount of power and we should look for ways to address it, it is not the existential threat that many people are claiming. Especially once you realise that the power used by ""always on"" or ""in standby"" devices in the U.S. alone is more than what Bitcoin uses. I also share with them that in my opinion the service that Bitcoin offers (a trust-less, decentralized, permission-less truth machine) is well worth the power it uses. I think it is all bullshit.  I suspect the carbon footprint from all the politicians traveling all around the world every year mirrors bitcoins consumption.  Where is that comparison?

So the problem is solved by offsetting bitcoins carbon footprint by eliminating all the politicians and, ready for this, return the power back to the people.  What a novel idea that would be! energy on bitcoin is worthless thats like energy to power your phones no discussion dude. you're clueless. a council can do no such thing. it's window dressing, and it's pro bitcoin. get over your paranoid fatalism. elon is trying to apologize to bitcoin. this is a gesture. free markets aren't govt.  bitcoin hasn't changed. how do you imagine this council can ""enforce"" any such thing? do they have guns and jails? bitcoin validation rules aren't changing. anonymous mining will always be allowed in bitcoin.  this ""council"" is bitcoin's green propaganda arm to fight govt's anti-bitcoin propaganda arm. not sure why you can't see it for what it obviously is: PR. It's what CEOs do. Tesla's business model has nothing to do with cars, it sells carbon credits. Yup, the rich are taking over. Mining converges to centralization over time due to economies of scale. It was always going to happen. The moment Alexandria Ocassio Cortez spews out talking points against bitcoin like a parrot....thats the moment to double down on bitcoin. I agree with your concerns.

Militant environmentalists can be very organised and very vocal... Yet completely uniformed about bitcoin.

Hopefully bitcoin will not care about another power play for it! Lies about the climate are one of the great power plays of our lifetime .... I hope Saylor is playing the bad guy on purpose to teach us no one can be trusted to lead us. I hope. Yes they will do that. Expend licences and exchanges will only be able to sell bitcoin coming from those addresses. But hey bitcoin community had years to develop privacy features, yet they did not do it.

Check out this thread by someone who actually does it. https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106939193085952?s=21 Bitcoin uses too much energy. It accounts for a fuck tonne of electricity for a tiny tiny fraction of financial transactions. If this is going to actually go mainstream, something needs to change. Why wouldnt they stream the meeting for us all to see? Why have it in private? All this seems fishy and we should all be cautious of the narrative that is playing out. Yes, but why Saylor is siding with that initiative?

Bitcoin doesn't care about licenses. If Bitcoin's incentives work then it shouldn't matter if they want to get licenses. If it is a coordinated effort i must admit im not mad.

Occupy Wall Street began in September 2011, long after Bitcoin was developed. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street Power play.. Ha. /r/ConspiracyTheories I agree but where do we go from here. I‚Äôm developing a project to empower the masses by freeing our minds through raising perceptions. That‚Äôs are only way not to be controlled.

You know Nicolas Butler said back in 1931 (an associate of JP Morgan) the following:

The vast population of this earth, and indeed nations themselves, may readily be divided into three groups. There are the few who make things happen, the many more who watch things happen, and the overwhelming majority who have no notion of what happens

We are all the majority of peasants been fucked over continually by the institutions. There‚Äôs one way to free ourselves and that is empowerment through perception studies. Raising the thresholds of our minds. this is a clear theme for grabbing power in multiple spheres Hashes don't know what energy source powered the silicon that produced them.

If governments have a problem with dirty energy thats great , criminalize dirty energy producers.

Energy users are not the problem. Governments could easily lock up the owners of dirty energy companies and solve the problem at the source. Turn this argument around on those actually burning the dirty fuels. Bunch of people who didn't give a shit about a scorched earth sudden give a shit about it once their control of the financial system is threatened. Why didn't you continue thorium research half a century ago when initial tests proved it to be more efficient and less dangerous than uranium? Oh because coal margins are higher and you can't make bombs from it? cool cool. At least all the Tesla owners refuse to use any dirty power.  They only charge up using dandelions, rainbows and unicorn horns. Same as agriculture. Puts the onus on individuals not corporations or governments. The people pushing also know young people care so much about the environment that connecting anything to worsening the environment will deter young from using it no shit Sherlock Elon Musk has been abusing the energy narrative because Tesla depends on it.  The company isn't even profitable without selling the carbon credits they get for producing 0 emissions vehicles.

Some states have revised the laws such that electric vehicles are liable for the carbon emissions of the local power plants to try to fix the bad math.

Either way this is just FUD and crypto will be fine. Or...or....they are real and the Bitcoin Cult is not able to face the real issue. True Well yeah. The conspiracy theories around this meeting are a little on the crazy side. No one is talking about licensing. No one is talking about restricting anyone from mining. No one is talking about even cooperating on anything.

You know what they're talking about, which everyone should be in favor of? Transparency. Literally all they're talking about is agreeing to be more transparent about what sources of energy they're using, how much, etc. 

That's it.

Does that mean that no one else can do this? Does this obligate anyone else to do so? No and no.

Just stop with this whole ""DECENTRALIZATION IS DEAD!!"" nonsense. Nothing of the sort has happened. > power play

lol

!lntip 2021 Because when digital miners use solar or wind power, that coal power no longer exists or is used by any others. 


:'D It‚Äôs simpler than that. Tesla is not a car company. It‚Äôs a carbon credit company. Tesla makes most of its profits from selling carbon credits. Elon Musk just exploited a situation to the point that he could compel the American crypto industry to become their customers Obviously. Elon musk i‚Äôm Sure accepts payments from visa and MasterCard for his Tesla‚Äôs. Has he ever questioned where they source their energy? Their entire infrastructure surely uses far more energy than bitcoin mining. Very well said This is why we need better fungibility on Bitcoin. These same billionaires fly around in their private jet planes fueled by diesel. They don't give a shit about pollution!

Remember when Trump said windmills cause cancer? Yeah, I'm sure this has nothing to do with these windmills being in the same place of his resort hotels. This is why it's important to inject counter-FUD in conversations with normies (because it's a trend these days for them to 'share their opinion' on BTC after it was in the news again, as usual).

Just tell them social media uses a hundred times more energy, or that mining could be done with completely green energy. F U D + control The energy narrative is a power play against freedom in general and I hope some people start realising that.

These are relevant and important. READ THEM. Can anybody/anygroup stop bitcoin?

Answer is no

So stack sats and chill First off, if you are worried about a power play against Bitcoin, you fail to understand Bitcoin.

You can throw whatever the fuck kind of power you want at Bitcoin.  If you do, what is going to happen is you will have lost whatever power you threw at it and Bitcoin absorbed and adopted this energy to become more powerful.

Second, Saylor and Musk hold Bitcoin and as such they serve the orange coin as do we all and are helping to bring about the prophicied hyperbitcoinization.  **THEY ARE DOING MORE FOR BITCOIN THAN YOU OR I EVER WILL**.

I do think Elon misunderstands the monetary economics and this may lead him into apostasy, but as for now he is serving the orange coin, so he is one of us.

You need to climb the fuck down from your self appointed position as Bitcoin's gatekeeper.  Bitcoin doesn't need Musk or Saylor but it sure as hell doesn't need you either. I have the ultimate solution to greenpiss whining about btc energy usage. Destroy all central banks, and get a 75% discount on energy consumption!

I'm not too fussed on speed, just the mechanics of how it works. A python script would be ideal, I have found a couple of reference scripts but they all use the getwork RPC command that has been depreciated.

Cheers for any help.";2;"I dont know about any scripts, you maybe can find some old cpu miner software from 6+ years ago. That won't let you inspect the code tho.

You could read the whitepaper, the basic process is listen for transactions, verify transactions, add them to a block, and then hash the block until PoW requirements are met (hash starts with a certain number of 0s). Once done, you broadcast it into the network. That's pretty much it.

But be aware, for doing so, you need the full blockchain up to this point. Here is one using getwork.  It would not be hard to update it using getblocktemplate: [https://github.com/jgarzik/pyminer](https://github.com/jgarzik/pyminer) and this hardcoded example might also be interesting: [https://github.com/subhan-nadeem/bitcoin-mining-python/blob/master/mining.py](https://github.com/subhan-nadeem/bitcoin-mining-python/blob/master/mining.py)

The theory explains how, over time, a product or technology gains momentum and spreads amongst a specific population. Bitcoin, like all innovative technologies before it, is following a predictable and transparent adoption curve, albeit, at an accelerated rate.{}

252;How do you hide an alt-coin in the bitcoin main network?;nlwwo0;0;1622080062.0;beaker38;"There have been three main strategies (at least 3) used by get-rich-quick honest looking fucks to leverage the bedrock of the bitcoin network and the bitcoin idea.

The first is alt-coins. Fire up a variation, privately mine the shit out of it, release it to the public, shill morons to buy it, cash-out.

The second is to directly manipulate btc development to the point of a contested hard-fork. Do your own research for details.

The third is subverting the bitcoin network blockchain by essentially creating an alt-coin within the bitcoin network. Colored coins and Tainted coins were explored in the earlier days of bitcoin and died a death too slow. There are probably others (I hid from this stuff for a few years).  Now we have curious bedfellows pushing Green Coins. They're not calling it that yet. And it doesn't matter if that's the plan of all of the players. And it doesn't matter if it's a conspiracy or just a flawed idea. What matters is that creating an infrastructure that allows tracking btc mined with the perception that those coins are somehow more desireable, is a terrible idea. It doesn't have to be a conspiracy to be bad.

The promise of Green Coin is nothing less than a foundation for an alt-coin existing within the bitcoin network. It's mined by a closed set of participants. And if it gets legs it will be traded as a separate entity. Governments will open up payments to these selected coins while blocking others. The extrapolated possibilities are sad and entirely,  180 degrees, the opposite of the purpose of bitcoin. Again, it doesn't matter if these ""side-effects"" are the intention of the people pushing it. The existence of this arrangement makes it possible which means a lot of it will come to pass. If you don't believe that then you haven't been paying attention.";4;"I am instantly suspicious of anything labeled as ""green"". interesting idea, like a block could have a green certificate Certainly one ""potential"" explanation. You could be right. Or maybe just high? but it's not an altcoin. and it doesn't exist. and you don't know wtf you're talking about. obviously. also, are you suggesting any of this is a problem? or are you just pointing it out? because it's not obvious any of it matters. none of it threatens bitcoin in the slightest."

261;Massive regulation can be expected if bitcoin price follows the stock to flow model;nm2dua;0;1622102033.0;wajza;"Why? Just consider the cost structure of bitcoin mining. I use the following values (it does not have to be precise, everybody can try her/his values and note the result below.

So assume the cost structure as 50% profit, 25% hardware, 25% electricity (0.25), further assume current BTC price of 40 000 USD, current daily reword 900 BTC, electricity price per kWh low 0.05 USD, high 0.15 USD. This gives: 0.25 \* 40 \* 900 / 0.05 = 180 000 000 kWh of electricity a day, which is 65.7 TWh a year for the low electricity price (bitcoin mining is argued to utilize electricity of as low price as possible, but it is easy to say that it would be three times less with the high electricity price).

That does not sound that much. However, the stock to flow model predicts the BTC price to go 100 000 USD this year, and to 1 million USD in four years when the mining reward will drop to one half. This results in 164.25 TWh later this year and 821 TWh in four years. Assuming global electricity generation of 25 000 TWh, this represents about 0.66% and 3.3% of the global electricity generation, respectively.

Consider, that countries have difficulties to fulfill their emissions reduction targets. Therefore, they will respond by a massive regulation. Still, I believe, this can be avoided. It would be enough if the bitcoin community would leave the protective position that it is not BTC which is a problem, but the electricity generation mix, that it is not only BTC consuming electricity, but also TVs, facebook, etc. While it is difficult for governments to touch TVs and facebook which are widely spread among people, it is fairly easy to touch bitcoin.

However, there is still a chance for bitcoin. Just take this as a serious threat and act accordingly. Any solution introduced by the bitcoin community will be better than any solution which can be expected from governments.

Make your own calculations with your desired BTC price, mining cost structure and electricity price - just do not forget to adjust the reward if you consider the price in a different halving cycle. And note that the lower the electricity price, the higher its consumed volume.

Edit: I know I ignored the transaction fees which are added to the mining reward. However, adding it just increases the miners reward, therefore, it would result in even higher electricity consumption. ";4;"You totally ignore the fact that fees slowly take over the rewards for mining.

That in its own forces a different balance than you describe.

I don't even see what is wrong with some regulation if that would be about just using excess green energy to be used for mining?

This is where natural forces are pushing Bitcoin mining anyway...

Neither do I think your predictions will hold about energy usage since at some point the additional needed energy would be either more expensive or if not would be more excess green energy available thus not be an issue to start with?

The energy used is for the protection of the protocol against abuse.
That will be a balance and by default reasoning be worth it or not, giving Bitcoin its existential reason or not. Your 2nd paragraph contains one crucial flaw - you assume that those percentages do not change over time.

For this to be true, it **must** mean

1. if Bitcoin's price increases by X%, the hashrate **at least** increases by X% too
2. electricity usage either scales linearly with hashrate (if #1 price increase and hashrate are the same growth rate) or, if you provide for the fact that chips get more power-efficient every year, then hashrate must increase by more than X% in order to keep Watts/BTC mined the same.  If hashrate simply follows BTC, we're using less energy per satoshi mined over time.

This is simply not the case.  In theory there is nothing preventing a $100k BTC price with the current hashrate and power usage.

Further issues I see -

1. Nowhere do I see a mention of how much increased energy **production** (not **use**) Bitcoin has caused.  This is a valuable metric, because there are claims from the other side that some BTC mining uses surplus energy - i.e. energy that was unused and could not be stored, so would have been pure waste.
2. You are using a year-on-year increasing figure for Bitcoin energy use, but keeping your global energy use projection constant over those years, arriving at your 3.3% figure for 4 years from now.  That is disingenuous, even if the real projected figure would probably not change by more than 0.5%.  It's somewhat ironic that you advise us to not forget to adjust the reward in *our* calculations depending on halving cycle while neglecting this.
3. You are discounting the energy use of existing systems, some of which may even be replaced, but all of which use more raw energy, by a large margin.  It's simply not fair to criticize Bitcoin in isolation to those other systems.  This is the biggest issue with people claiming to try to help Bitcoin's energy ""problem"" - you guys forget the biggest energy abusers are the existing systems.  Now once I say this, the common retort - a **valid one** \- is ""but those systems have trillions of dollars of flow, so energy per dollar is lower"".  And that's actually *my* point (see below).  You are fixated on energy use of a mined Bitcoin, and it's a non-starter.  The real discussion and innovation happens around metrics that matter.
4. You are comparing energy per cost of Bitcoin.  Why?  Have you compared energy use of the Euro system per EUR/USD?  No, because it's kind of nonsense to do that.  I don't even know what it would be likely to prove - maybe turns out the US is the most ""wasteful"" by that metric, or maybe developing countries are.  But it's meaningless either way.  The correct cost analysis for Bitcoin would be energy use per value transacted across the network, probably.  And yes, today BTC is a bit low on that pole.  But it can get better with L2 initiatives, and without bringing mining into the equation at all.  You should encourage people to use LN.

New Movie Bitcoin Seduction Unravels The Mystery Behind The World‚Äôs Biggest Digital Asset

[https://bitcoinseduction.com/](https://bitcoinseduction.com/)

  
LOS ANGELES May 26, 2021 (Blockchain Wire)   
BITCOIN SEDUCTION ‚Äì The Ultimate Financial Fantasy‚Äô (IMDb) is a soon-to-be-launched project from the stables of BS Production & Crypto Film Fund as the film takes the audience on an amazing ride detailing hitherto unknown facts about Bitcoin (BTC) and the digital currency space. The docudrama features personal interviews, scripted dramatization, and animation, telling the story of how a computer-generated currency has been able to disrupt the global financial system.  
  
Bitcoin Seduction is a docudrama that tells the story of how a computer-generated intangible coin, conceived by a mysterious creator, captivated the world and laid the foundation for what many have now come to see as the genesis of a future egalitarian global financial system.

  
The film features legendary anecdotes of the fortunes lost and gained, the world-changing innovation that has materialized, and the ensuing impact on civilization as new blocks get added to the societal chain.  
  
Bitcoin, the duodecennial digital currency, has become a bi-directional seductress like few before, capturing hearts, minds, and wallets, with some proffering a second economic coming, while others experiencing a d√©j√† vu of tulip crazes. Regardless, bitcoin has become an ever-present figment within popular and financial vernacular.  
  
Bitcoin remains a major part of the digital currency space, regarded by many as the mother of all cryptocurrencies. Despite the increasing popularity and acceptance of BTC, its origins and how it works remain a mystery to millions of people worldwide.  
As with other tales of seduction, like Adam, Eve, and the serpent, or the Sirens of Greek mythology, there is a story to be told. Cryptic inventor producing a cryptocurrency, cogitating on hopes of an egalitarian economic order. White papers turning faces blue with intrigue and green with envy. Anecdotes of million-dollar pizzas. Roller coaster fortunes rising into the billions and back to nil. Even investors technologically foreclosed from reaping generational gains due to lost passwords. Quite the story.  
  
The planned contents cover some of the more sensational and controversial events already littering Bitcoin‚Äôs history. Bitcoin Seduction seeks to reveal information that has remained unknown to the world since Bitcoin emerged in 2008, especially regarding its creation, a subject that has remained a topic of discourse for over a decade.  
  
It features legendary anecdotes of the fortunes lost and gained, the world-changing innovation that has materialized, and the ensuing impact on civilization as new blocks get added to the societal chain. The project also takes a broader and more comprehensive look at the world of digital currency and blockchain technology, with experts weighing in on topics adjunct cryptocurrency.  
  
To the BTC salivating public, Bitcoin Seduction is a docudrama that traverses the history and histrionics of a computer-generated intangible coin.

276;Bitcoin's evergy use bullshit put to rest;nlkgw1;65;1622044840.0;Selfish_Development_;;12;"This is an extremely good video to send folks to if you ever find yourself in an argument online over Bitcoin's dirty energy use. Everyone should bookmark this. Who made this? Sounds like Nic Carter and written by him.  It's very well done I love these types of documentaries. Brilliant work! Seriously great video... it makes me think people aren‚Äôt all idiots I have a very basic noob question: why was it necessary to have mining in the first place? Why not just start off with a fixed supply of 21 million coins? Facts don't matter when you are talking to the eco-nazis though.  It's a religion based on faith. This is what the climate change nut jobs do, they go after any and everything that doesn‚Äôt fit a political agenda.

It‚Äôs not about making the world a better place.  At least, they would weigh the pros and cons, but no, they are a cult A question for the more rigorous scientists in the house.

So I read that soil, oceans, trees, etc. absorb carbon. Natural carbon sinks, I think they are called.

Now If all the power generation for bitcoin were really located physically in the Netherlands (cuz you know, they tell me bitcoin uses up one Netherlands worth of energy), I assume a certain amount of carbon could be absorbed locally in these sinks in that geographical area, and the rest would make its way around the globe.

But if bitcoin mining is widespread, let's say 100 various locations around the globe, wouldn't the local carbon sinks in those 100 locations absorb much, much more carbon, than in the exclusively Netherlands situation? Doesn't much less carbon (not absorbed in sinks) go floating dangerously around the atmosphere in this case?

Is this accurate? Anyone have an idea if it's significant? Good argument though it is still flawed. The example of Iceland and Sichuan cases of curtailment assumes that the creation of cryptocurrency is the only possible and valuable product that can come from curtailment (where price of energy drops below 0).

If the price of energy is maintained at 0c due to mining instead of being allowed to go negative (curtailment event), you are in fact DISINCENTIVZING other high energy forms of production such as aluminum production, energy storage (load shifting), syn-fuels, hydrogen production which are all useful products that would support carbon reduction that requires negative pricing to work.

Those products cannot be created as long as mining prevents the cost of energy from going negative. It‚Äôs simple to explain how a comparison to Visa is wildly inaccurate:

If Visa disappeared the monetary system it is a part of would continue. 

If Bitcoin disappeared the entire monetary system it *is* would disappear.

This illustrates neatly just how small a sliver of the monetary system Visa, which is huge, is. It‚Äôs perhaps even impossible to calculate even remotely accurately how much energy that system uses. https://wintonark.medium.com/bitcoin-mining-impact-on-renewable-uptake-fc91c5aa9be0 It is in US's self interest to keep the dollar regime in place regardless of how much money is printed. By US interest , I mean the intertwined nexus of politicians & businesses ( regardless of ndustry) and extreme amounts of energy is wasted ( or used , depending on your perspective) to keep this regime on place. The dollar standard regime backed by the US military might is a super-imperial regime through which the US can financially cripple countries on the other side of the planet without exercising it's military might.
We want to believe that cryptocurrency will upend this system of $ hegemony which essentially provides the US with a free financial ride at the expense of the rest of the world, but this is completely unrealistic. It relies on the very thing/system many think it will replace, thus invalidating it as a challenger. We may want to believe in a technological solution to our social, political & economic problems but that has seldom ever been the case. 
Lastly the energy use debate has entrenched sides, the answer is more nuanced & people know that to be case or are lying to themselves & others.
We all want to make money in crypto for a myriad of reasons, but we don't have to be religiously delusional about it."

279;Why AMC GME and an over leveraged financial system is bullish for bitcoin;nksxp0;5;1621957812.0;Adventurous-Bat-7819;"I can‚Äôt help but look at how exposing the manipulation and corruption with what is going on with over leveraged hedge funds, recklessly shorting stocks, and manipulating the market to their benefit as one of the most bullish cases for bitcoin and blockchain technology.

Just to be clear- I am in full support of the AMC GME MOVEMENT- a group of intelligent Reddit users banning together to put together awesome DD to expose a long history of corruption in the market. It‚Äôs not just a get rich scheme, it‚Äôs so much more. It‚Äôs about market makers and the 1% no longer being able to say ‚Äúcapitalism is great for you, but socialism is great for me‚Äù as they are bailed out with out tax dollars over and over.

Anyway though, what‚Äôs the solution after the dust settles? An open ledger. Transparent system. One that no government can control, because they have proven themselves untrustworthy and irresponsible, only concerned with themselves and the 1% club. We need a financial system that works for the 99%.

I know this is just one price of the puzzle, and with the recent concerns and FUD with bitcoin, I just can‚Äôt help but wonder who is driving the narrative of crypto. Bitcoin was originally created because of the flaws of 2008, and I think the 1% must be worried that their market manipulating days may be over sooner than they thought. 

I have been holding since 2016, will continue to hodl, and wonder when bitcoin and crypto will have the same conviction that AMC and GME developed. Don‚Äôt treat bitcoin and crypto as a get rich scheme. Treat it as a way to be free.";3;"I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs new corruption. It‚Äôs simply playing by the same set of rules big money and market makers play by. 

Wether or not they squeeze, simply holding the stock has caused hedge funds to bleed money in interest. ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù are quick to tell everyday people to not risk more than they are willing to lose. When average joe loses their money, too bad. When big money loses, different story.

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs brought much needed visibility to issues. https://old.reddit.com/r/TheLightningNetwork/comments/nje0jv/if_there_was_a_decentralized_lightning_network/ amc and gme might think they represent some kind of anti-corruption movement, but in reality it's just a new kind of corruption. the only good thing about the mentality that would lead someone to invest in amc or gme is that these people can see parts of the corruption they were blind to in the past. now they just need to open their eyes to the hopelessness of their current pursuits in shitcoin equivalents."

285;The Green Mining Council is pro-BTC PR to counter the ‚Äòdirty energy‚Äô FUD;nkrazz;6;1621953593.0;tangerineandteal;"
Leaving aside the arguments about centralisation, this is the most direct counter to the climate change FUD.

For now, BTC price hinges on public sentiment. It‚Äôs a beauty contest aimed at convincing the casual masses. 

Wall St and others who have interests in shorting BTC have weaponised a widely accepted movement: climate change; against crypto. 

Nevermind that gold/mineral mining is many times dirtier. Nevermind the finance industry creates more pollution than gold mining and all of crypto combined.

None of that matters because the world has agreed that climate change is real and as long as Wall St can smear BTC as a threat to climate change, their objective is met.

When news began trending re BTC pollution, public sentiment went sour. 

I went on r/Bitcoin to see if there was a solution. But most of the replies were too technical or focused on aspects that the masses would not understand. 

Public sentiment wouldn‚Äôt change unless leading BTC figureheads/whales got together and created a counter-narrative for the masses the gobble up.

This Green Mining Council is exactly that. For all of its faults, it‚Äôs at least a powerful sound bite to counter the climate change FUD";9;"Elon is a con man. I don't want  him around bitcoin

Thus your stop loss could be triggered and position liquidated, then by the time you can react to buy back in, the market has bounced back much higher.  

Plenty of people were hit a few days back when the market dropped around 20% within 4 hours and then bounced up close to 20% in the following 2 hours.

Repeat.

I'll only ever have 5% of my capital exposed. If the price dips ill make 1%.

I hope that these points will get better with ongoing development. I do there's no demand. nobody wants their retail purchases to be itemized on their 1040. Quite a few do. Anywhere that takes PayPal, takes Bitcoin. They don't accept Bitcoin because it would cost them money to begin offering that, and very few people would actually spend Bitcoins to buy everyday things, just like few people spend gold bars to buy groceries. A company needs cash flow to operate. I may be wrong here but it costs fees to convert these accumulated coins in this said company to ""real"" fiat money. They would possibly have to add a transaction percentage to make up for it. I use the crypto.com app credit card. It takes a little pre planning sometimes and again fees are high but it works for me. There are ways to buy stuff. Just not our preferred method yet.

I already had a script written and automated with AWS to post orders to Gemini's API everyday to automate my dollar cost averaging. I figured I could leverage that same script and somehow port it to my iPad / iPhone.

I started researching apps that let you run Python on iOS. Pythonista 3 and Pyto bubbled to the top. Pythonista 3 hasn't had an iOS update in over a year (and costs $10 up front) so I went with Pyto. Pyto has a 3 day free trial, a $3 lite version (that I was able to get the script running on but got some weird error messages when I put in bad values) and a $10 full version (that handles errors in the way that I expected). **I have no affiliation with Pyto or Pythonista they are just the first tools I found to run Python on iOS.** 

Pyto made it easy to install the python Gemini API I was working with and my code ran without needing really any updates. (Full code hosted here: [https://www.notion.so/rhettre/Buy-Bitcoin-on-iOS-using-Siri-ee91e10b3b484012a8b4e6d88cc3264d](https://www.notion.so/rhettre/Buy-Bitcoin-on-iOS-using-Siri-ee91e10b3b484012a8b4e6d88cc3264d))

Pyto also allows you create Siri Shortcuts that you can leverage through Siri or through a home screen app.

The actions I used to set up the Siri Shortcuts are down below:

The shortcut works really well for making quick limit orders to Gemini (which has the best fee structure of any exchange for long term HODLers - .1% buy fees + 10 free transfers / month. Avoiding the on chain transfer fees is huge).

I think I'm the first human being to buy Bitcoin with a HomePod, feel free to prove me wrong in the comments.

292;I am kind of disappointed at how most are bending the knee to Elon to get him to stop tweeting about btc. Bitcoin was created to free us from centralized actors, be it people or institutions, but some of us are not comfortable unless there is someone or something lording over them I guess...;nkp2hj;304;1621947279.0;MATabouti;;43;"I feel sentiment here is mostly Fuck Elon Bitcoin doesn't care Who bends the fucking knee? As far as I can see, everybody just thinks it's pathetic as fuck Fuck Elon Musk > Bitcoin was created to free us from centralized actors, be it people or institutions

Bitcoin is free from centralized actors. Bitcoin price speculation is not part of Bitcoin, is just a leech attaching itself

> but some of us are not comfortable unless there is someone or something lording over them I guess

Bitcoin speculation has no substance, so speculators adopt celebrity worship as a substitute Maybe if people would stop posting about this dimwits they would stop being the focus of the discussion. Just an idea Who's Elon? As long as coin is traded like a common commodity it will be subject to outside influence. Keep posting about him, that'll help. It‚Äôs just a shift in power from one capitalist system to a bigger one. I for one I'm so fed-up with him that I've decided I'm never going to buy any of his cars. I will be due for a new car in about 5 years.  Even if I'll want an electric, there should be enough options from the competitors to choose from. holy shit this subreddit is corny Fuck elon. Can we get a stickied megathread where we can just echo that sentiment? He's like the second coming of Roger Ver...btw fuck that guy too. But Cathie Woods and Michael Saylor are good Billionaires right? I see every bitcoiner bending the knee to them, like they were to Elon until two weeks ago. Oh wait, Bitcoin is just a tool for Billionaires and Goldman Sachs to manipulate a market (VERY EASY) and get richer. DOH! Bitcoin doesn't care. It's inevitable the meddling of men is only momentary. Weak People He needs to focus on exploding cars and grifting tax money from governments.

Nobody cares. He tweets and people head to their exchange without a second thought. short of him losing his Twitter this trend will continue until eventually everyone gets bored im betting on even a lower dip coming yeehaw Once CNBC started running BC on a banner, it was no longer decentralized and without influence.  It‚Äôs become a tool of the markets now and no longer controlled by the little guys. People aren‚Äôt decentralized. Propaganda and coordinated media campaigns still have affects on the public at large. Even here.

Look at the FUD campaign and the associated sell offs  coordinated with strategic pivots by large investment firms as well as the obvious wyckoff formation played around their acquisitions.

Big players are here and their manipulative games are here to stay most likely. Practice this.

""Whatever Elon""

Now the key is to apply this universally.  When he says we are going to colonize Mars, whatever Elon.  When he says the car has autopilot, whatever Elon.  When he says that Tesla makes money on cars, whatever Elon.

If he actually accomplished something, OK Elon.  Otherwise, whatever. Short Tesla and microstrategy It's still the low-volume phenomenon. It'll pass. Bitcoin was due for a correction anyways There‚Äôs nothing like trusting a total strangers idea of how the banking system should work ü§™ü§™ Block Elon Musk on Twitter. I did. Many others did too. Use the hashtag #blockelonmusk or #blockelon. He will lose any power or influence the more people who turn away. Amen to that! üéâ I wish there was another post about Melon Usk. I‚Äôm doing my part! # Fuck Elongated Muskrat!

# In fact, fuck all billionaires. Elon is a retard who has nothing to do with crypto. Tbh I don‚Äôt care about bowing or shitting on Elon. I‚Äôm sick of toxic maxis trying to elevate their Twitter status by trolling him all the time. Grow up. Stay humble. Stack sats. Peace We as human was raised to much trough that in the entire history. We are used to it. As sad as it sounds üò¢ I doubt he even affected the price, just fkin leave it out. This is getting boring This is true. Most people are brainwashed sheep, unfortunately No offense, but all things are subject to the opinions and emotions of the people involved. While Bitcoin is more free than many currencies, at the end of the day, it is still help by people, and therefore subject to whatever can influence those people. lol the fact every other post have Elon in it, shows how what he says matter, he is like the Donald Trump of bitcoin hate It‚Äôs called bitcoin not bitchcoin, everyone just stop Bitching and we can get back to hodling as always.  In BTC there is always a dip.  Who are we going to blame for the 300k to 100k dip? I‚Äôll tell you who, your mom. tweet him to fuck off and keep it rolling Omfg..Another post about this dude? Nobody with a brain gives a shit. mmmm too much fear I sense in you Bitcoin tech may be decentralized.  


The crypto market IS NOT. Leveraged trading, options trading and TONS OF WHALES = Not decentralized. This is why we can't have nice things.

293;Taproot and possible fork;nkrcqt;6;1621953718.0;Tor-ulf;"So I have been thinking a bit of the upcomming update to the network, but Im just a novis when it comes to the technicals but Im sure some of you are well informed.

I have read that a vast majority of the network agree to the Taproot update, but that leaves about 10% who disgree. They could just follow the flow agains thier will but there might be a fork, right? Like with Bitcoin Cash and Segwit update, have I got it right this far?

Well, if a fork happens then some of the miners will continue by thier own with the system we are running right now, while the rest go for the Taproot fork. Everyone who have bought bitcoin before the fork will then have funds on both chains, right? As both forks will check my rights to move funds to the same block. Have I understood this correct?

I got some followup questions depending on awnsers I will recive, so I leave it at this for now.

Thanks beforehand!";3;"~~If there's at least one node running the old code, and it happens to create a longer more valid chain with the 10% of miners that don't upgrade in November, it's possible there's a hard fork. But very unlikely.~~

Taproot is a softfork, ignore my mashed potatoes for brains current signalling is at over 96%, the activation will most likely go through after the next signalling period.

taproot.watch Bitcoin never ""forked"", only its name and blockchain were copied a few times. The now small percentage of miners that haven't signaled for Taproot yet (doesn't necessarily mean they disagree) have no other option than to go along with the longest chain and signal Taproot."

301;Bitcoin price falling ensures that fraudulent exchanges collapse, and that the fraudsters are exposed and cornered;nkqhsj;30;1621951391.0;BuildItMakeIt;"I'm reading about the fall of QuadrigaCX, one of Canada's largest exchanges, which collapsed when the price of Bitcoin fell in 2017. It exposed the exchange as a Ponzi scheme which did not have sufficient reserves:

https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/bitcoin-gerald-cotten-quadriga-cx-death

We need these massive price drops to expose the fraud in the system, ensure future stability and trust in the system.

If USD-T has insufficient reserves, and in fact was being used to pump the price of cryptos, they'll be exposed, as long as the price stays low for a few more weeks or months.

On that note, withdraw your funds! Don't let them sit on an exchange.";6;"2 turkish exchanges shut down. Just before the collapse and probably started this whole shitshow. First one sold everything cheaper then market to stole peoples money then closed due ""maintanence"" then the owner flee from the country (thodex)

Second one was a tiny exchange belonged to betting mafia, those guys coulndt flee but shut down the exchange while everyonrs money still in it and got jailed. Government didnt give anyones money back.

So yeah falls are necessary but exchanges are not trustworty even big ones can collapse or owners fall into greed and can try to steal. Apply Indeed the ""proof of keys"" test. i dont trust cbc...the last 2 elections they have been bribed by the liberal party of canada

ok so you say some falling prices exposed that quad did not have sufficient reserves..but we also know quad had really big problems with the banks freezing their funds or forcing them to use other more shady services

so to me it seems that if there was reserves they would not be known about,otherwise quad would be risking everyones money or coins be frozen by law or banks...so i think there is a good possibility the reserves had to stay in the dark

unfortunatly for everyone and conveniently for the banks he died in a foreign country with minimal witnesses and some unusual moves

now its a big mystery..but if you check the history of the owners of some of the new exchanges in canada it sure looks like they may be proxy owned by the banks

but i dont trust banks either lol so thats just my conspiracy story

also after there was some people that wanted to rebuild the exchange and pay everyone back over time through the profits from a exchange that would have been owned by those that lost on quad...but that was harshly and strangely critisized then swept under the rug as the worlds most expensive and oldest and dustiest lawyers were brought in to leech the last of quads funds that the banks had frozen Excellent observation.  
And then people go and blame Bitcoin for the troubles, when the trouble always is and always will be the middle-man in this context.  


The exchanges are the proof of people's failure to adapt to the Bitcoin mindset, as they still compare it to fiat. If you trade your Bitcoin, trade them for something tangible. Goods or services. Never ever fiat. That will always be a loss.  
So why would you need an exchange?  
Your wallet can transfer to other wallets on its own.

Plus, he realized the protocol is somewhat heavy for such things, so he proceeded bootstrapping the whole project from scratch with smart contract functionality at its core.

Although Bitcoin can do anything the entire crypto universe is currently doing, it will be always at a disadvantage in terms of efficiency because the code has become ossified and not very flexible, albeit still the best blockchain out there in it's most basic meaning.

Short answer is, no Bitcoin will not participate in the defi or any other future booms. Any attempts will be in vain IMO.

This dip made us newbies strong who bought high, held, and bought more through the dip. I am a believer! Let‚Äôs go BTC! I know it‚Äôs coming but the morning sell off is so annoying. $240k in december. That's my prediction.  


  


Either that or 24 months of winter. Nothing like having your wife (who wants nothing to do with investing) drop this line on you in the morning: 

‚Äúhey honey, I just saw a headline about GME and AMC, I sure wish *we* kept some of that instead of put more into crypto‚Äù 

Yikes I think we have to split up now.

I put a decent amount for me into GME/AMC round 1 and made a small bit which I immediately used to buy more sats. She‚Äôs usually supportive but this time the smugness was real. Rant over sorry folks

Edit: you guys are awesome I‚Äôm sorry to have vented here... it‚Äôs no big deal we have a good relationship and all but with the timing of the ‚Äúcrash oh my god crypto is crashing‚Äù and now the ‚Äúsqueeze oh my god it‚Äôs happening‚Äù she couldn‚Äôt help herself. Generally she‚Äôs chill and I feel bad now lol you guys are great. Definitely going to take your ideas / suggestions 3 million members.  congrats, future hodlers! Bitcoin is too relevant to stay low forever. men this 1 week accounts are coming in hard, with all this news of banks ETF's, and funds accepting BTC has a store of value asset there are still crazy people around shorting? jesus men just go buy something for you or your family don't lose money like this, volume low, sellers high and the price hoovers on 39K like a champ this shorters have no idea what a rocket is I am prepared to buy the dip because I have faith that bitcoin is a great investment.üöÄ This is insane entry point. Folks are loading up Will we wake up to 42k Tomorrow? Let‚Äôs keep getting higher daily highs! It‚Äôs always going to fluctuate a bit. Who will be shocked if Tesla shows they loaded the boat with BTC after the recent Muskrat act that cost us 50%. Not this guy! Just watched the Australian version of The Lost Boys. It‚Äôs called The Lost Blokes. It‚Äôs just like the original version except the vampires mess with didgeridoos at sunset and they have these gnarly kangaroo pets that wreck random people walking down the street.

BITCOIN 115k EOY. PSA everyone this BTC discount is a really good deal. Why are we even surprised? Its almost Thursday. The dip is normal. It's gonna go back up on Friday, up some more on Saturday, dump on Sunday, recover on Monday. Rinse repeat. I just got into crypto maybe 3 months ago and I love roller coasters, nobody told me it would be this fun. 3 mill subs lesgo Getting those ‚Äòcomeback is on‚Äô Rocky movie vibes watching BTC try and push through 40k 40k, baby! Over 40k üöÄ omg 30k and 35k was just a dream for who would be early again. Who really believed on Bitcoin bought the dip. I unfortunately hadn‚Äôt money last week. Receive salary this week, but happy for that I have so far. üíéüôåüèªüöÄ New all time high will be June 6 Sellers frantically trying to get back in now Niccol√≤ Machiavelli had argued that sometimes it is ""a very wise thing to simulate madness"".

bitcoin will take over the world The weekly chart is green now for the first time in a while. We are just baiting shorters, chill out. Where do I file complaint against The Sun hovering over US? This reminds me of the highway changing lanes conundrum.  How many times have you just stayed in the fast lane just cruising while some other idiot is weaving between lanes trying to get ahead.  Staying in the fast lane usually gets you there quicker and without the stress and potential of crashing your car.

Buy, hold, enjoy and watch everyone else try to time the market and lose their bitcoins. Cryptocurrency: 
Ride the wave! 
Tell the banks to f*** off and make them behave! I‚Äôm feelin pretty bullish

Guess everyone is glued to the screens waiting for the DIP or RISE... the suspense is bone chilling!!! üòÇ Most people here are totally clueless. In the future 1BTC will be worth millions. 

Just barely reaching parity with gold will yield $500,000. Btc to 422k by mid monday I have FOMO for those that kept getting to buy Oooh look at those bands getting tighter fellas.

Their twitter site looks sketchy and also it does not provide any info.

There's also no info and if you click [here](https://gyazo.com/6f5e7a3fa804aa2260a5330b589871ba) it just goes back to the top of the page.

Also, if you go to 'About Us', there's no info whatsoever, just some very generic statements.

There's also this low effort video with a few testimonials from some of the people receiving food that doesn't prove anything about the real scale of the operation:

Not surprising. Keep stacking, everyone. This story will grow legs after the data shows a spike in bitcoin mines operating outside of China. I've read, and heard Saylor argue, that it takes about 2 years to bring a substantial bitcoin mine online. So we'll see more decentralized mines outside of China as we continue forward. Less after the next couple halvings i suspect. But still enough to bury this fud I know the title is a bit less inviting with all the uninformed articles and FUD on the topic recently, but this one is a really good read by one of the Coinmetrics guys (they provide valuable on-chain network and hash rate data), diving into the intricacies of bitcoin mining and mining data and the current narratives around it.  

> [...]  
> Most importantly, this is a gigantic opportunity for Bitcoin to address two of its most frequently overblown criticisms: its reliance on Chinese miners, and the carbon footprint that this reliance entails. We have seen an overwhelming number of ESG initiatives pop up as direct responses to concerns around Bitcoin‚Äôs carbon footprint.  
>  
> With this in mind, the timing of the CCP‚Äôs latest wave of regulatory scrutiny could not have been better. The ensuing miner exodus currently taking place is one of the most positive fundamental developments for Bitcoin in 2021. Even if we see short term drops in monthly Implied Hash Rate figures as miners emigrate, it would be for an important cause.  
> [...]   
> On the other hand, if we don‚Äôt see a considerable decrease in monthly Implied Hash Rate, but miners still geographically disperse, Bitcoin will have become substantially more decentralized at the expense of short-term price volatility. A good trade if you ask me.  
> [...] It doesn't really matter that mining is being shut down in some locations since difficulty will simply readjust. It seems scary... but it really just lessens the chance of a 51% attack. Me neither i don't see it as a bad thing that China is banning crypto mining , the time has come for WEST to take over the markets and mining... This is good for Bitcoin. Damn good  article. CryptoLoki should read it. So should the OmahaTwins. Alas, that is not what Loki's and Tweedledums do, do they? China has always had a reputation for shooting itself in the foot, ever since I don't know when. Mao doomed millions with his Great Leap Forward. The Ming dynasty was ruined because of a betrayal and their defective military. Qin Shi Huang lost his empire because of his Legalist policies. China doesn't change. It can push its e-yuan all it wants, but only thing it will do is to make it as isolationist as it was in the Ming dynasty. Who would want to do business there when the money's bugged intentionally?

316;The next five years;nlffoq;32;1622030987.0;Maticus;"I am an ultrabull in the long run. I feel very confident that we will see a $5 Trillion crypto market capitalization in the next 30 years, and that's a very modest estimation. But Bitcoin has the reasonable potential of hitting that in the next 5 years and will be closer to $50 Trillion in the 30 year timespan if it meets certain bench marks. Institutional investors are waiting to see two things. Bitcoin has proven that it is secure throughout this decade long stress test of the tech. Security will always be a concern but much less so than it was 5 years ago. Volatility is also not much of an issue so long as the price increase in the long term. The volatility is likey more a symptom of Bitcoin's youth rather than an inherent feature.

So what are the institutions waiting on? They want to see if Bitcoin is uncorrelated in two key respects. First is, of course, inflation. During inflationary periods assets rise in value, which Bitcoin is seen as an asset. It's the correction that is troublesome. If rates go to their market rate during an inflationary period, it pulls capital from assets and assets that are dependent on credit will contract. This last happened when the fed took its foot off the peddle under Volkher in the 80s. Bitcoin has never experienced rates above 4 or 5%, so we still don't know what will happen when it does. But it needs to hold its value during periods of high inflation and high rates to be seen as a hedge. 

Next Bitcoin needs to be uncorrelated with the stock market and an economic downturn. Since 2008 we haven't had a true blue recession. So we don't know how Bitcoin will react during a recession. Bitcoin needs to be uncorrelated with the overall economic climate, similar to how gold performs.

So why is this all important? Why are the next five years key? Well we're due for a recession. This is the longest period without one ever. Secondly we're likely to see run away inflation soon. The two could combine and we will see stagflation. The world will be watching to see how Bitcoin responds.";16;"We will see a 5 trillion dollar market cap for bitcoin within 5 years. 30 years? It could reasonably happen in 30 months. Even sooner... We may hit 5T this cycle. This is just 5 times from ATH. how is 5 trillion market cap in 30 years ultrabull? seems like youre a bear to me >$5 Trillion crypto market capitalization in the next 30 years

this is ultra bearish compared to my sentiment

edit: i have some disagreements about your predictions though, mainly about inflation and stagflation. but i guess that's unimportant since i do agree with the main message that BTC is going up up up in the long run Hey bub. hate to break it to you-- we are currently in a recession. Covid-19 Recession (February 2020‚ÄìOngoing). Nah I don't know what your background is but from my experience, legal risk is always the biggest risk to institutions. They're waiting for clearer legal framework on Bitcoin and other cryptoassets. Most are in wait-n-see mode imo. When you say $50 trillion in 30 years, are you talking 2021 dollars or 2051 dollars? There will only be 1 million BTC left to mine in 2025, and it‚Äôll take over 100 years to mine that last million What would be the price (in $) if btc with a mkcap of $5T? It's a pity you don't tell where those numbers, 5 and 50 trillion  come from?

My basic reasoning:

Bitcoin is better than Gold.
Thus it will overrun Gold its market capitalization, now roughly 10 Trillion from my mind....

After that I will re-evaluate things (timing is not that important to me  but roughly next bullrun being a year after next halving..). Ultrabull, I like that. institutions want control. Fiat control Wasn‚Äôt it something like 1 trillion in 10 years, then the 2nd trillion in a couple months from this year? I feel like 5T will be a lot sooner in the next 30 years 200 to 300 trillion market cap is actually a modest estimate. Unfortunately because of leverage/margin calls, Bitcoin will correlate to an absolute certainty of 1 with stock market crashes, at least while it's so young. The crash of march 2020 demonstrated that.

Protip: Hedge your Bitcoin against stock market crashes and inflation with S&P500 futures and short 10yr Treasuries."

326;How do i stop regretting FOMOing into the top?;nkvqmo;4;1621965100.0;Lalabeejbeej;"Basically I bought high, and now with this crash I cannot stop kicking myself for not spreading out my buys and buying so near the top. Knowing it can take years potentially for me to even break even is more psychologically challenging than hodling when you are in the green and it just makes me feel unenthusiastic about the whole situation.

Did anyone else buy high like me? What options are there besides selling at a huge loss?";23;"I am once again asking you people to dollar cost average. It won‚Äôt take years bro.

Hold your tits. Don‚Äôt make any decisions until December Wait 4+ years. Now you‚Äôre one of those people sitting far in the green that don‚Äôt care about 50%+ corrections. If bitcoin succeeds that top is gonna be real low. Don‚Äôt sweat it I put 70% of my spare money in around 58-62k. Yeah, it sucks, wish I'd been patient and just trust that it'll go down and been able to buy 40% more bitcoin.

I know myself though, if I'd discovered bitcoin later during the dip I probably wouldn't have bought out of fear or not really committed myself to learning what bitcoin is and why it works. Now that I have skin in the game I have all the incentive to learn more. FOMOing in around 60k was my newbie tax and I've accepted that. At least we haven't sold, you know? You thought bitcoin was a good idea at the ATH, so why wouldn't it be now? Nothing in the way bitcoin operates has changed.

> Knowing it can take years potentially for me to even break even is more psychologically challenging than hodling when you are in the green and it just makes me feel unenthusiastic about the whole situation.

Yeah, you come down from that initial rush of ""wooooo I finally bought bitcoin!!"" and realise you got no more money to throw at the thing and now you're in the red. I can't say much to this other than understand that bitcoin is a long game and in theory should appreciate in price over time. It may take months or years for you to break even, but that's the risk we have to take with this kind of new asset. We just don't know, the market is honestly kind of insane and works in very unpredictable ways. The safest and least emotionally taxing way is to buy a little bit regularly and not think too much about it. My plan is to put ¬£50-¬£100 in every 2-4 weeks, withdraw to my hard wallet once the balance hits 500, rinse and repeat.

I know it sucks right now but I'm glad I finally got it over and done with. I know what I own and I'm willing to ride this train to its final destination, wherever that is. Average down. Buy a little each week. Or month. Depends on your budget. Just realize there's nothing you can do to change the past and focus on positioning for the future Buy low until you are green. Little by little. What you can afford to lose. Little by little. You will be OK. Keep buying in. I bought the top and the bottom. Just stack sats! In 10 years, it won‚Äôt matter that much if you bought at $60,000 or $30,000 wait 1 year No worries. Just hold for a few more months. Never sell at a loss. Regret will fade & hindsight has 20/20 vision. 

Do not beat yourself up for this because at that time with the information that you had you felt like it was a good price to enter. Now the price changed and you have new information- so yeah on hindsight you would entered lower. 

Happens to everyone! We are all learning by doing here. 

Your options:
- lower your average buying price by buying more cheaper.
- unrealized loss (if you expect the price to recover)
- realize loss (of you expect the price to crash further) 

What suits for you is entirely up to you, your view on the market development and your risk appetite I'm in the same boat. But I learned a lesson from my recent losses: I buy every dip greater than 10%, while it is dipping (yes, exactly). Any pump greater than 20% I sell. So far it's working. I did this and got Musked the very next week. Consider me schooled. I consider it a good lesson I needed to learn. Don't stop. Hold on to that regret, and it'll become wisdom, and save you from doing it again. When I bought at 800, did not sell at 1200, and then it went to 200, it was painful. Now, this crash does not bother me that much. It is with time btc changes you, pain goes away, and than you only buy & hold. wait until the next halving cycle if it doesnt happen sooner. Look at the history of Btc prices and ask yourself honestly what you think is going to happen over the 1, 5, and 10 year periods. If you believe it will increase in price I'd suggest not touching your initial investment and slowly adding more. Tell yourself the truth that the market is irrational and nobody can really predict short-term (less than1 year) price behavior. 

I'd say be thankful you got in when you did and got the experience you did. Now that you know the deal you know that the ""boring"" times are the times to DCA in, and you will have a better idea what is going on in the next FOMO cycle. 

Only invest what you aren't afraid to lose, or what you aren't afraid to tie up for a few years. Almost nobody succeeds in get-rich-quick plans The lesson you just learned will be incredibly valuable in the long run (and not just with bitcoin).  Don't beat yourself up over it.  It's human nature to learn 'the hard way.' Safest top you‚Äôll ever buy. No walk-in clinics needed Don't worry about the price. Worry about accumulation! >Did anyone else buy high like me?

Yes, remember the guy who bought at $30 shortly before it [crashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZ8zDpX2Mg) to $3? What a fucking moron, buying bitcoin at $30 bucks. General sentiment is that the bull-run will end around March 2022.  You have a lot of runway to recover that loss.  Listen to Willy Woo, Plan B, Will Clemente, Investor's Podcast Network Bitcoin Playlist.  There isn't even an ETF in the US yet, there's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines, so try not to panic."
327;I'm now seeing the trend of the new investors making Elon Musk some kind of ruler of Bitcoin. If you're investing in Bitcoin because of Elon Musk's tweet, sadly you're now diverted from the true purpose of Bitcoin to liberate people out from individuals, institutions and government control.;nkjzlo;8244;1621928165.0;esqandar;You just make yourself a slave of Elon Musk's tweet. And that's sad.;246;"Maybe.... stop talking about him? Fuck Elon, fuck anyone trying to be a bitcoin Jesus Unpopular take but this is inevitable as bitcoin grows. Say the ultimate theory of hyperbitcoinization comes to pass in 20 years or something. You think everyone owning bitcoin is an anarchist intellectual fighting the good fight? No... Bitcoin is going to be like water to the fish that swim in it, and 99% of the people won't care about it beyond that.

People buying bitcoin due to Elon's tweets will come and go and cause volatility, but it's am inevitable step in the larger journey of this technology. Gatekeeping will only cause your own blood pressure to go up, so I'd just make sure I got my keys in a safe place, buy the dips that result from these sudden adoptions and go with the flow.

Also, every newbie who comes along because of Elon has a chance to evolve into a lifelong holder. In the short term it can be annoying but in the long term it'll strengthen bitcoin. Stop posting about him then. The more you guys bring him up the more power he has. There will only ever be one ruler of Bitcoin.

There will only ever be one Satoshi Nakamoto.

We are all Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Elon Musk can go play kiss chase with Craig Wright as much as he wants for all I care........those guys live in their own dream world and just love to try to sucker other folks in.......FOR THEIR OWN FINANCIAL GAIN.

Elon treats his employees like shit. He has a history of taking credit and placing his name as the 'inventor' for things that he has no initial involvement with. He constantly manipulates people for his own gain. He publicly calls people 'pedophiles' or other false/derogatory slurs if they reject his foolish ideas. He calls out BTC for energy use issues while selling carbon credits to some of the biggest energy consuming corporations on Earth. 

He's a Grade A Legacy Establishment Prick and the sooner he fucks off to Mars, the better. Can someone explain to me how a one-world digital currency that publicly tracks every transaction is liberating? I‚Äôve been worrying lately that if we do get BC as the world‚Äôs currency, eventually governments will work to control it. When that happens, we‚Äôll have far far less liberty. No. If Bitcoin is what we believe it to be, it doesn't matter *what* he does, or the affect he has on the market. It doesn't matter what *anyone* does. No one's missing the point. Bitcoin doesn't *have* an innate purpose. The fundamental property of bitcoin: ***no one can control it.*** It is decentralized, with a consensus method for change. It creates one block every 10 minutes, forever.

The only thing anyone can do is manipulate the short term price with FUD/FOMO.

Musk has led many people to the water. If they drink it, they will have no need to play follow the leader anymore.

This doesn't absolve Musk of being an asshole, though. Lol bitcoin ain't liberating shit from shat. We just wanna make money and maybe conduct local and international transactions that don't involve all the bank hassle of traditional methods Every time the exchanges go down we get a taste of just how liberated from institutions the people really are. Like him or not, he's not going away and his tweets will continue to move the market for a while. It's annoying, but that's reality.

I would rather see him shilling green mining than pumping shitcoins.

I'll continue to mostly tune him out. I called elon a cunt on wall street bets sub and I got 3 or 4 PMs calling me a ""communist bitch"" and ""elons way is the capitalist way and the only way"". I swear his fan boys are the worst Stop pretending that we were some community of idealists, this didn't happen because of Elon Musk. People diverted from the true purpose of bitcoin when their main reason to buy it was to make gains. Which is 99% of the people. Myself included. Don't get me wrong, i support what bitcoin stands for but if there were no gains to be made i wouldn't be investing in it. Lol let people invest however. You want a unregulated currency but dont want to deal with the pitfalls that come with it. The government/institutions are doing a pretty good job of controlling it though.

Pretty sure I saw an article about one mining company producing the first  OFAC compliant block with only KYC'd transactions in it. Goes against so much Bitcoin was originally about. Dude you cant have your cake and eat it too. You want as many people interested in bitcoin yet throw a fit because they heard about it from Elon musk. Get over it. Hes brought up some valid points about bitcoin that nobody wants to discuss. Hes allowed to have an opinion and people hold his opinion in high esteem because that guy has and is accomplishing more for society then any of you could dream of.  Also quit complaining about it because it does absoloutely nothing. If you have unshaken 100% faith in btc then your invested for the decade. Sounds more like you actually dont have faith in the tech because you have to complain about elon causing a small drop over a tweet. I get (and agree) all the hate against Elon, but thinking if most of us were in his shoes, 99% of ua in this sub would do the same.  Make a billion dollars in a month by tweeting a couple things? You got it. That just shows how flawed Bitcoin is. You brag about it being decentralized and unregulated. Then you cry when it is so easily manipulated We're all here to make money. Play his tweets to your advantage. As long there are enough people believing in the purpose and buying it I don‚Äôt are about that prick. But yeah‚Ä¶BTC is already a cash cow‚Ä¶ Quote from Neo...‚ÄùThe One was never meant to end anything. It‚Äôs just another system of control.‚Äù Anyone who trusts Musk is a moron. Honest question - how is bitcoin supposed to ""liberate"" when more than 50% of it is mined in China? This sub is full of pathetic cry babies üòÇ shut the fuck up already Although I do agree with the sentiment towards Elon Musk, the purpose of Bitcoin is to be P2P money, something that Bitcoin apparently isn't anymore because of the high fees Right move for the wrong reasons is still the right move. Watch Bitcoin come to heel by the Chinese and American government.... It does not liberate you from those things. Don't be ridiculous. Who cares, besides you and the turds? Elon¬†is only¬†acting for¬†his¬†own¬†benefits,¬†so¬†stop¬†talking¬†and¬†acting¬†based on his¬†tweet,  do¬†your¬†own¬†research, create and grow your own influence.

If¬†Tesla,¬†SpaceX, and¬†DeepMind¬†became¬†something great,¬†it's¬†because of¬†him and his¬†people¬†not¬†us, so why he would¬†care¬†about some random¬†people¬†on the¬†internet¬†who doesn't¬†even¬†help¬†him with any of his¬†work.

Based on his act, I think he just want to play the market, play with people who have paper hands and play for the short run not the long run. 

If¬†we¬†benefited¬†from his¬†works¬†then¬†it's great, but¬†if¬†you got¬†harmed then don't blame him.

Remember this, other big institutions didn't stop the acceptance of crypto as a commodity, so I think this is their way to leverage they way in to the market.

P.S. I am sorry if there is any grammatical error or wordy sentences. People are controllable pawns. That‚Äôs why the current power structures of society exist to begin with. If they were all truly independent-minded, there wouldnt be as much disparity in power between the elite and average people. And ironically this is one of the reasons Elon is a fan of bitcoin. I don't think he is purposely manipulating anything. I think is is simple figuring out what his business strategy should be with crypto and people are taking is normal moves waaay to seriously. > I'm now seeing the trend of the new investors making Elon Musk some kind of ruler of Bitcoin.

Where.  Show me your source.

Cause this looks like pure karma whoring to me. Most people are in bitcoin to make money. Not to liberate people. That‚Äôs the sad truth as Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted. Long term  Musk is a nothing burger. I started investing in stock back in the Dot Com era... We were making buckets of money week on week... But we had our own Elon Musk... We had Allan Greenspan. He would let out a cry and stocks would drop 20 30 %... Then the bubble finally burst and people were left holding some companies that had nothing but a dream... That was when the DOW was just cresting 10K... enough said! Believe or don't, your choice, your future. Investing is not for the faint of heart. It's people doing sentiment analysis versus quantifiable analysis. If you hop in someone else's car, don't complain when they end up somewhere different from where you wanted to go. And if you do end up trading based on other's opinions, make sure they can logically and mathematically explain their reasoning. Math has no alternative motive; people like Musk do. True that. Isn‚Äôt the whole idea of some sort of council counter to the purpose of Bitcoin. This sub is so dramatic As Michael Saylor said bitcoin is greatest invention of mankind after centuries equivalent to invention of fire or something I thought it was created so ransomware people can collect money easier and cleaner. How do we know Musk isn't really 'Satoshi Nakamoto'? there is a difference between being influenced by and being controlled by No offences but if you followed Elon past years it would have payed off reaaally well I repeat as always : cryptocoins are for the ease of use and free of taxes, it's not a stock market. This sub has become a non-stop pep talk directed at people that aren't even here. Can we please pin it to the top of twitter?

This bizarre obsession with EM and his grandiosely inflated not-so-nice ego is cringe. Bitcoin is a great invention and anyone can still mine and anyone can still have their own wallet however, practically 99% of people are going to use it through centralized services, keep their bitcoin in coindesks, or kraken or paypals wallet...etc.. Not saying  99% of the value will be there, just 99% of the people who use it

Also when it's like this you push a button and it turns into any other crypto, when does the BTC brand mean nothing? Do you change your bitcoin to Al's laudra-mat coin before going there because that's all their washing machines take?

When you go to buy something with crytpo will you get charged capital gains?

Will a defi service that takes loans against your bitcoin as you spend keep you from getting taxed? Will these pseudo banks be willing to hold your BTC against the loan forever in exchange of using it as investment capital or cash in on it's appreciation as an asset? pass it on forever to avoid the tax?

Where the hell are we headed to? I bought into it because I want more money Let's make an Elon fork. 'Fork Elon' It's no different them weebs deciding to invest because some posted here about bitcoin Lmao ""true purpose"" of btc.. thats long gone my dude
If you believe btc still stands for its original purpose, you really naive.. this is why i‚Äôm worried about the mining companies creating a cartel, that centralized power is a no no, can‚Äôt happen, we need to remember who made bitcoin the power it is today, it was the poor people who held it and mined it from home for 10 years. I‚Äôm just here for the money. I couldn‚Äôt care less what he says, as long as the price goes üÜô It doesn‚Äôt matter, people are still sheep. Baaaaa ""you're now diverted from the true purpose of Bitcoin""

Hahahahaha Bitcoin broke 100$ and this subreddit was already well diverted from the true purpose of Bitcoin. 90%+ of all the money in Bitcoin is people just investing in it to make some more USD. Hardly anyone gives a fuck about the implications anymore.

Multiple people in this thread saying things like ""it's just gambling"" or ""we're all here to make money"". Hilariously tone deaf Can we really talk about decentralisation and safe heaven assets when a single person can influence the price, hence the value of that asset, hence of that technology, in such fashion to destroy millions of dollars per tweet? 

Bitcoins value and relevance (same as gold)in the end is a matter of social consensus. If the social consensus decides to give such power of influence to individuals, that at the same time has the sufficient power to influence on the techology as a whole then we might not be as decentralised as we think. 

And I am bullish on #btc because I believe in the tech. But in the end is up to us all to decide what we do with this technology and what consensus we reach. Who‚Äôs Elon musk?? I‚Äôm far from been a EM fan, however I do believe that if BTC mining isn‚Äôt cleaned up in the long run we will see the value of our BTC flatlining...ok you can begin the onslaught of abuseüëçüòÅ Its is still evolving ... there will be time crypto will take over real currency and that what nations and banks and financial institutions fear the most Guys, its just gambling. Thats all you‚Äôre doing at this point Fuck Tesla, buy Ford EVs. Elon musk is a narcissistic market manipulator. Since Elon Musks latests Tweets the only things I did were:

\- Insult him in one of his tweets  
\- Unfollow him  
\- Keep focusing on crypto ...knowing Bitcoin is mainly owned by a few people/companies üòÖ Hahahaha the whole of BC is owned by the banks, it's already been corrupted. Liberate from the people haha what bullshit. If your truly invested in bitcoin you welcome anyone building on the bitcoin blockchain, it's how the Crypto grows. It's not obligated ANYONE listen or pay any attention to musk! Do I like Tesla ? Yes , do I like Elon was able to manipulate PEOPLE into having an effect on bitcoins price ? No, it says alot more about the minds of the people invested than it does anything else. Buy the dip & be happy, or shell and sale/sell and shut the fuck up. Elon is my favorite billionaire, my views may be slightly bias. Bitcoin has already been taken over by the government, sad to say It kills me that people can‚Äôt see how he is blatantly manipulating the market. He‚Äôs a charlatan. 

He‚Äôs basically the Donald Trump of tech and finance bros- except his inherited wealth came from much more dubious circumstances. If anyone thought that Bitcoin or any other crypto currency would do whatever you wanted, you're so wrong.

Money talks. That's it. Elon/Tesla could buy almost the entire crypto space right now. That's the sad reality.

And whales and wallstreet will take over any currency out there, because they have the power to do it.

We, the peasants, will be reaping the crumbs, as always. Musk has never been more irrelevant to Bitcoin than he is now. His Tesla's are garbage and I would never exchange my hard earned btc for some crappy ""back yard range"" electric car. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt going to liberate anyone anymore. It will become the rich mans currency. What's sadder is you and your clone drones posting the same post content ten times a day. 

Seriously, shut the fuck up already. On your 7 year old account, a good third of your karma is from this shitpost.

No one cares what you think about the matter. You're upvoted because you're reposting the same rehashed ""opinion"" that a group will automatically upvote. Crap attempts at memes, talking about ""cancelling"" people,.. sorry to say, Mr. Musk isn't the ""cancer"", it's you assholes wasting how many man-hours each day talking shit while that man gets more done before finishing wiping his ass in the morning. He's a great, neuroatypical man. Whereas you're a bunch of plebes wasting more of our time. The Elon Musk hate is so weird. Having a successful billionaire as a pseudo mascot is actually a great thing. Not sure if the hatred is a jealousy thing or a hipster thing about being involved with Bitcoin before the Musk train. Either way, the hate is silly and unwarranted.

Edit: spelling Yes, the whole idea of the Bitcoin Mining Council is bad for the same reason. This is not what bitcoin stands for. for the love of god, can we somehow ""cancel"" Elon from crypto? this guy is destroying the entire space. the majority of people unfortunately want to be governed and controlled - safety and convenience over liberty is an easier existence for those at the bottom of the pareto curve. I can't believe the number of people blaming Musk for losing their life savings.  What boneheads Add Saylor to the list too. He‚Äôs a known fraudster who should not be trusted. DogElon is the new RogerVer....

(I still have the hope, that he really just trolls because of SEC otherwise, he's just a douchebag) Ignore the noise, run a node. There is nothing stopping Elon Musk, or any billionaire from ‚Äúinvading‚Äù a truly decentralized currency. If you want to ‚Äústick it to the man‚Äù then retail needs to coordinate a massive dump to leave the billionaires holding the bag until they panic sell at a loss. Similar to the GME frenzy, albeit that was against a short sell, but the same principle applies, organizing retail buying/selling habits. Yet it's current price is unaffordable to the average person so... It's the rich people's coin. ü§î Kinda went the other way on this one. In those people's defense, Bitcoin also lost sight of all those principles the moment it was created since it doesn't really do anything whatsoever to achieve those goals and instead is yet another gambling vehicle for those with excess resources to gamble with. Elon is this cycles john mcaffee. Grifter trash. #elonacoaster ask him about cobalt and teslas The true purpose of Bitcoin is for China to make money. It's the only reason it's even considered somewhat successful in the first place. How else would this wildly inefficient, costly-to-transfer resource even be considered for a currency/store-of-funds replacement? China is currently pumping it while trying to take control of the majority of the mining. Quote from Max Keiser;

BTC is decentralized, It belongs to all of us, meaning there is no central authority.

This narcisist car salesman can not handle something that is not all about him. He can not even build a single car that makes profit, he has to trade carbon credits just to float his two bit car company.

Hey muuusk, get over yourself narcisist sick car salesman, we are here to teach you a good lesson...you f\*\*king phyco... You all sound like a bunch of purist cry babies. Narrator: so institutions started buying it..... Just as you never know the way the market will go, so too is true with the future if coins ...Ok? Is it true that 97% of Bitcoin is owned by 2% of the wallets? I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs trying to be the guy, I do think right now we need all allies we can. Shits going to be shaken again and again. If you have whales that keep shaking things coordinated it‚Äôs going to be the end of crypto at some point(or at least the biggest one). The fact that there are so many attacks tells you what people know. This is a war. In digital age. We are seeing it happen and it‚Äôs only going to get worse. Things have been shaken up. 2017 was just a sample. The more people can buy with confidence the better it is for the community. No your not. Business men always rule the world and Elon is also doing that. Making huge profits. Elon supporter here, fly elon fly! I'm new, in for about 2 weeks and luckily I don't have Twitter so I tried out this reading stuff tactic where you actually read things of substance rather then tweets. On that note any recommended reads I should check out would be greatly appreciated. It's a good thing those people don't know about full nodes. And wouldn't even care if you told them. Trend huh. Can you give one example of whatever it is you are talking about Lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ To be fair, if you'd go for the purpose of cryptos, you wouldn't use BTC, you'd use a proper coin, lol."
328;"""What flavour of dip would Sir prefer this morning? Flash crash? Liquidity hunt?"" - From the horse's mouth, how the big boys take your bitcoin";nkre5j;29;1621953818.0;DesignerAccount;"Tweetstorm by [@twocommapauper](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper):

[1](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106939193085952): Some inside info on FUD & fucking with markets by someone who's had blood on their hands (many times) before.

This is going to be decently detailed, so sit down & take your time.

I'll also add some proof as I dig through some old drives (without doxing any clients obvs).

&nbsp;

[2](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106940745031681):1st a quick intro. Prior to my move to crypto I was a Sr. exec in the dominant company in one of the most competitive sectors out there. My P&L alone was larger than that of some small nation states. We were also highly regulated with over 125 licences in ~100 jurisdictions.

&nbsp;

[3](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106942221463556): in 2016 I YOLO'ed into crypto by launching a full service company covering:

‚Ä¢ Legal and regulatory - Meh

‚Ä¢ Solidity development - Pumping out those shitcoins you all love

‚Ä¢ Marketing & PR - Pumping your bags to the moon

‚Ä¢ OTC - For the smart money to exit with minimal rekage

&nbsp;

[4](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106943718723584): In all we serviced ~50 clients, mostly vanilla ERC20s but also some early ERC721 (NFTs as the kids call them). Back then we were using them to build stuff like SKRs for physical gold for private banks in HK, CH, MC etc. 

We also did a lot of sentiment management for our OTC desk

&nbsp;

[5](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106945811783682): So, say you're a fund wanting exposure to $BTC but think you missed the optimal entry. If only there was a dip you could enter in.

Cue us - What flavour of dip would Sir prefer this morning? Flash crash? Liquidity hunt? Ah, excellent choice! **The End of the Bull Market it is!**

&nbsp;

[6](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106947283955712): So we're gonna crash the markets to allow you to scoop up cheap sats.

Step 1 the ground work - We pay several low tier media outlets to publish bearish news but not promote it on their channels. It just sits there for now.

&nbsp;

[7](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106950865784841): Step 2 - Pay several contributors to Bloomberg/Forbes etc to publish hot takes on the story citing the article 
It's easy as: 

a) The starving writer meme is real 

b) They're desperate for fresh content  

c) Compensation is tied to the amount of traffic their stories generate

&nbsp;

[8](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106953554432004):So now the content is on some low tier news sites & a few tier 1s. This is where you break out the rolodex and ping every pasty tech writer you ever bought drinks for at a conference & FOMO them in. 

You're missing the story dude, it's on Reuters too FFS, you need to publish NOW

&nbsp;

[9](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106955131437056): Story is gaining momentum & it hits the PR wires. Its on all sites from NewsBTC to Reuters so it's obviously legit. 

Time to break out the CT Influencers. These guys all tweet out the story or variants of it with key words that sentiment algos pick such as ""ban"", ""hack"" etc.

&nbsp;

[10](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106956574265349): It's now time to tie it all together by initiating the dump via our algo. This is the opposite of the standard OTC algo, in that it looks for the thinnest books on exchanges which comprise Futes price indexes (CB, Kraken, Gemini etc) and market dumps on them.

&nbsp;

[11](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106958029762564): Retail sees the dump, rush to twitter to find that CT in engrossed in this new story. They panic as algos start to dump and liqs begin. 

Retail sells, cascading SLs & Liqs finish the job & drive price to your orders. We dump on any rally to keep momentum high.

Bingo.

&nbsp;

[12](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106959409717248): That's all for today. I hope this was educational, and when the next perfect storm hits crypto you'll remember that it's perfect because it's engineered with military precision by professionals.

&nbsp;


### TL;DR HODL!! Give them your sats on YOUR terms, not theirs!!";6;"Funny, insightful, could have been written without being an insider, but the point remains. It's plausible. Any chance you could give us some indication of what the plan after the dip is? Is there a time frame for when these clients want their coins to rise? Impressive & thanks for sharing. Is there any proof besides the screenshot provided? Genuine question about approximately how long clients need before they want it to go up again. One reads a fair amount of insider posts but on balance I believe your situation is probably true, so the chance to find some more info out is tempting and thank you for sharing. So is there a general time agreement and is it Bitcoin in particular that they accumulate or a variety? This is why I stopped reading news back in 2008 - attaining my age of reason.  
It is just people trying to out-retard each other in exchange for money.  
The intellectual porn industry; how cheaply they can sell their souls in exercise of popular opinion.  


Which is why I always joyfully enjoy the masked depression of employed journalists or scientists, only allowed to operate within a formulated mindset and intellectual playroom.  
Social media regurgitators are just like shrimps, they live on the intellectual faeces that outlets let down to the bottom to fight over.  


The intellectual hierarchy does not deviate much from the financial.  


If it is important enough, it will hit my radar. I do not need media to shoot it at me. Nice to see the 4chan LARPing has moved to Twitter. yeah bitcoins price will remain artificially suppressed until the elites have their bags filled :/"

330;Analysis and results of ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù using BTC historical price data;nlr6cm;11;1622062265.0;CrosscourtFade;;3;"TL;DR (something we keep repeating) 

the data is clear: **waiting for the dip is worse than dollar cost averaging, and waiting for bigger dips tends to hurt more than it helps.** It's striking to me that the effect of most of the 'buy the dip' strategies is so minimal. I'm not surprised that they do worse on the whole, but I am surprised that 'only buy if the price is lower than yesterday' is almost a wash compared to daily DCA. tldr; Bitcoin is more volatile than stocks, so perhaps a ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù strategy would have more opportunity to work effectively. Since Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, many investors find it to be a dubious long-term investment. Since we can‚Äôt be certain what the future holds, our best bet is to back-test various strategies against historic Bitcoin price data.{}

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4 right now you are investing in the internet 3.0. Bitcoin has significant liquidity for its market size. With around $20 Billion in daily trade volume, traded 24/7 against every fiat currency in just about every country on the planet.

You can get a bitcoin debit card and spend wherever Visa is accepted. But people see it more of a savings vehicle as it's in early adoption phase. It has outperformed all other assets over the last 10 years yet still around 2-3% global adoption. Plenty of up-side potential to go, yet highly volatile so advised to slowly accumulate a position over time.

Any questions just ask here A lot of shit on the dark web Weapons.

I mean.. candy NFTs and a lot of other cryptocurrencies. other crypto coins Steroids and mushrooms Bitcoin is not a widely used medium of exchange. That's the third stage of the evolution of money. Bitcoin is at the second stage of the evolution of money which is a store of value. Bitcoin is liquid because you can quickly exchange it for any other currency. Over 60 billion dollars worth of bitcoin has been traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin is a very liquid asset. You can buy fiat with it Is Google down? Scanned the comments and thought i'd just add in that some bullion suppliers are also accepting crypto, mainly btc, at a premium I'm a male gigolo that only excepts bitcoin so...... Certain shitcoins. You take your Decentralized Bitcoin which is owned by the Centralized banks over to the Centralized exchanges that convert it back into Centralized Fiat Currency and spend it as you wish"
332;Shark Tanks Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, is practically calling for a Bitcoin protocol change. Suggesting premiums on btc wrapped as ‚Äòclean coins‚Äô moving forward. (About 13 mins in);nlmkf4;12;1622050227.0;CowboyTrout;;17;"No, no, no, no, no. **A resounding no.**

In time, institutions will have no other choice but to bend the knee to Bitcoin in its current form; as it was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Observe that the petro dollar is tanking, central banks are running amok worldwide and there is fear of a realization amongst nations that they are increasingly becoming bankrupt and the writing of their demise is on the wall. As such, **Bitcoin does not need institutions**, institutions *will inevitably need* Bitcoin. 

Moreover, Billionaires such as O‚ÄôLeary that call for a green or clean coin are **simply pulling a scam**. They did not amass enough Bitcoin early enough on, so **Kevin O‚ÄôLeary attempts to level the playing field** so he can now buy-in with his billions in fiat to have the new, clean coin that is worth more than the plebs that acquired more than he is able to purchase. 

**THIS IS A SCAM!**
**IT SHOULD BE CALLED OUT AS SUCH AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY REJECTED!** Fuck him.  He's a scumbag. Yeah, good luck with that. Assigning provenance to coins starts to eat away at fungibility. 

Can someone knowledgeable on Taproot tell me if mixing will make these proposed ‚Äúgreen-coins‚Äù no different than any other? 

Also, why can‚Äôt Kevin learn from past mistakes, like the block length war where the devs told big business to fuck off! I would support a protocol change allowing any coin touched by O'Leary to be labeled as ""filthy"" The take aways from this video are:

1. Governments are going to use the ESG scoring system to try and control crypto the same way they control means of the production.  If you do not know what the ESG scoring system is, look it up.  It will be used to control your behavior through your purchases and investing, as it is already used to do this for corporations; see Telsa as an example.
2. O'Leary knows the power of this type of regulation and wants to be at the forefront and really shows his narcissism.  So much of everything he said was about him and what he is doing.  While he is correct about the power of regulation, he was really doing a lot of virtue signaling to them, in an effort to make himself a leader and a credit in this area.
3. ""Their"" solution to not being able to control Bitcoin is to create a way to have blessed coins and unblessed coins.  Once an easy and reliable distinction can be made, the government controlled fiat world will have barriers, bans, and extra fees, and taxes for the unblessed coins and for those who use them.   Expect to see this at fiat exchanges and when you file your taxes for you that are US citizens.  Governments love to pick winners and losers to stay in control, and this is how they will do it.

A briefer on the ESG score:

E - Environmental; that is, how does your business help the environment or hurt it according to the government's opinion?

S - Social \[ Justice \]; that is, how many non-white, non-male, non-heterosexual employees do you have, what positions in the organization do they have, and how much are they paid?

G - Governance; that is, how does your business benefit government, and how compliant and cooperative is your business with the government and its regulation? 

Bad ESG scores will keep one from government contracts, getting loans, licenses, tax breaks for business expansion, and banking features such as perhaps an account.  The benefits of a ""good"" ESG score are obvious. Just dust all of his(or everyone‚Äôs) accounts with ‚Äúdirty‚Äù Bitcoin and shut him up. Wrapped bitcoin my ass! Just trying to take more money from Bitcoin holders that's all! Get out of here with that bullshit Bitcoin Green will be his fork.

Or something douchey like O‚ÄôBitcoin Green

Mark my words. i told you. No thanks, Kevin. Good luck with your ""premium"" Bitcoin at a premium price. I liked it better when we had to deal with Roger Ver and the finger flipping :) Just a few short years ago he (like Mark Cuban) was full on anti-Bitcoin, now he wants to be taken seriously.

""Nothing burger"" , ""crypto garbage""

üôÑ The dude does not understand what it means to have a ""clean"" coin, you have to fork and get miners on board. Everybody loves to tout a free market until they can't control it. You won't get consensus. If you think otherwise - fork on and let an actual market decide. /u/Fiach_Dubh

After your write up on here and this clips. I‚Äôve gotten more concerned. 

Thought you would be interested in this. hey kevin all those people you hired and all that money you putting into defi you must be soo smart now..

but why are you not telling the world 'where' the interest comes from from your 'extremely complicated' defi scams? The world would be a better place without people like Kevin O‚ÄôLeary in it. The guy is not relevant and never was. She looks good on camera... dayyam."

If all miners suddenly stopped mining, how would that affect the price?

I thought this person was a friend and since I have no experience with things like bit coin I did a bit of research after the fact and now I'm a bit concerned.

The transactions were already completed and I put the money sent to my PayPal into my bank account so I could use it on cashapp.

Since the deed was done (earlier today). I've cut off all contact with this person and have no desire to speak to them again.

So what now?";26;"Its 50 freaking dollars the feds are not coming. Where is the scam part? Buying bitcoin is not illegal. Maybe they're trying to get around KYC rules or they're a minor and unable to buy via an exchange.  Could be lots of reasons.  Maybe you helped launder money too lol Lmfao feds not coming for no 50 lmaoo Paypal has a 6 month dispute window. So the chance exisits that they might claim that you never delivered and they want a refund. That is the only negative that I can think of. you cut someone off over this? lmao damn I‚Äôm not sure what the problem is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. They sent you $50 and you sent them the money/Bitcoin back to cashapp‚Ä¶ no scam from what I see Now you wait for the knock Outside of you paid the fees no scam from what I see lol They must be laundering money in some way. Hopefully the $50 you received doesn‚Äôt get changed back or reversed in some way. 

Was this friend hacked? You‚Äôre subject to the taxes on gains. They are not. It‚Äôs $50. You‚Äôre going to be fine, bud. It‚Äôs $50, I wouldn‚Äôt think twice about it. No one is laundering illegal money $50 at a time.

Only potentials are that they request a refund from PayPal to try and screw you (not sure if they can now).

They may just want anonymous Bitcoin, but at $50 it‚Äôs not really beneficial or as others mentioned, they‚Äôd keep upping the amount before trying to scam.

Maybe they had someone else‚Äôs PayPal access and wanted to steal money, but who knows. I‚Äôm confused. They sent you money so that you can send them Bitcoin via cash app? What‚Äôs the issue If you haven't net lost money, you weren't scammed He prob wanted the bitcoin to gamble with. A lot of the online sites and those ghetto video slot machine casinos don‚Äôt take cash. They only take bitcoin. Sounds to me your friend was tying to get his gambling fix and the only way he knew how to get a small amount of bitcoin without having to pay high fees like that of an bitcoin atm was thru you. Where does this friend live ? If one of us are close we can check him out... Well Bitcoin is banned in China so you may be arrested and brought to China to be thrown in prison for the rest of your life, gg. ""the deed"" It depends on why they had to ask you to do it not themselves, and what they are going to do with the BTC?  - in the future ask the question before you do it for someone else...

Privacy?  Underage minor?  Bad history with PP / exchange? Gambling? Drug/illegal purchase? Porn? Terrorism financing? I really didn't expect this post to get so much activity. Dang You will probably get a reverse charge from PayPal because they most likely used fraudulent payment. This means you will be at a $50 loss because there is no way to reverse Bitcoin transactions. Classic tried and true scam. I‚Äôve heard of a lot of new people getting scammed this way. It was a lot more common years ago, guess it‚Äôs made a comeback. Nobody is going to turn your world upside down over 50$  
Had it been 500$ you may have had a reason to worry.  
5000$ and it deserves the real questions.  


50$?  
Nah. Your story would hold for 50$  
And you only bought Bitcoin, that is not illegal. I think what‚Äôs going to happen is that they are going to file for a clawback from PayPal to get their $50 back. Your bitcoin however, cannot be clawed back. So in then end you just gave them $50.

This is a typical scam with PayPal because of the claw back mechanism for disputing transaction.

F to your $50 Oop. Well. Guess I'll ready my butthole for federal. This happened to me once, a so called friend sent me $5 once for Bitcoin. All went well until 7 days later I had a knock at the door and the feds were here. 

I thought this must be a mistake because I didn‚Äôt partake in any illegal activity. Then they showed me the print out logs of the blockchain. The binder was so big with literally every page of the chAin printed. I still recall him flicking to page #532,123,999 with my transaction highlighted in green.

Personally, I do care about the message, but the money is certainly a far stronger reason. Am I the only one?";19;"I'm in BTC because I value my labor more than my boss and my country. I like to not lose its value through inflation over time. I am in bitcoin to save time! I‚Äôm 59 yrs old and my son talked me into buying some bitcoin last year. I buy a set amt monthly. Don‚Äôt worry about current price. I took care of both my parents before they passed away and my goal is for my son to be able to do that for me, if necessary, with my bitcoin. I‚Äôve been self employed for 30 years And while I‚Äôve always been able to support myself, kids, parents, I did not have any retirement savings. So I have 15 years from now on my mind. My tax accountant thinks I‚Äôm out of my mind. Wants me to buy mutual funds. I know my son is brilliant and since he‚Äôs the one that will ultimately be in charge of my money I want him to have a say in my investing. This does not mean I will not buy some mutual funds as well. [removed] At this point and being so pissed at the current system? I am more for the message and more for the change.

I can print more fiat by working, but it solves nothing.

Some people say BTC is a ponzi scheme. And what is our current monetary system? Centralized ponzi scheme. I mean, I am probably more motivated by money than I realize, but I do love the tech and want to see it grow. I just like charts and graphs. Everyone 99.9% otherwise nobody would sell and the price won‚Äôt go down hard if most people believe in it and don‚Äôt care about making money out of it You would never be able to make any money if not for people who aligned their self-interest with the interests of others or even sacrificed their self interest for others. You would have been born a slave.

Self interest is what's required to make doing good sustainable. You should find something that you enjoy doing that improves the world and is sustainable. That is the purpose of life.  
  
Self interest for its own sake has a degenerating influence and ultimately makes man less noble than the animals. its good to storage money like regular stock except hidden from governemtn Is ""making money"" the same thing as ""preserving wealth"" or ""preserving purchasing power""?

Saying that people are just ""in it for the money"" is a fallacious argument because the literal purpose of any asset or currency is to transfer purchasing power across time, so yes we are all ""in it for the money"" ""Making money"" could also be thought of as inflation of one asset relative to another I'm in it to make my daughter and maybe Sunday grandkids money. Why would anyone spend a deflationary asset?   Unless you were spending it on another asset that you thought would gain even more value over time?

Me?  I‚Äôm just holding every Sat I can buy with spare cash for when I retire in 15 years time, and if BTC keeps going up, hopefully that retirement comes sooner. bitcoin is money. so...... everyone. I‚Äôm in it to save money. If by 'make money' you mean increase my fiat stack, hell no.

If by 'make money' you mean wealth building in the sound money that is bitcoin, hell yes. The short version is, I'm in bitcoin because US gov took down Liberty Reserve, e-gold, and proved they could also swoop on anything similar to those whenever they felt like it, including any hypothetical future services not even created or launched yet... but instead, the take-down-proof bitcoin was invented.

Exchange-rate increases were a nice bonus though."
341;Bitcoin (Btc) To Hit $100,000 This Year Despite Present Slump: Tom Lee;nkzt1m;2309;1621976206.0;DaVibes;;142;"tldr; Wall Street strategist Tom Lee thinks Bitcoin (BTC/USD) still has the potential of reaching $100,000 this year, despite the market slump. Bitcoin fell to $30,000 on May 19, which is a fall of over 50% within the month. Lee stated that even though Bitcoin is ‚Äúextremely volatile‚Äù, those who hold on to the token will get their reward very soon.{}

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* Sounds like Wall Street wants people to put more money in BTC.... He said Bitcoin would hit $100K 4 years ago üôÑ. Doesn‚Äôt he at least have the balls to raise his price target to $1 million? Tom Lee has put out so many bullshit numbers re: Bitcoin over the years that never happened even remotely close to his timelines that I'm actually shocked anyone gives this fucking guy a voice. Tldr random guy out of 1000000 economists/whatever makes a claim.

This supports our confirmation bias so posting for upvotes Bitcoin (Btc) To Hit $69 420 This Week Despite Present Slump: u/fuckin_normie Mr. Lee does not a good track record... I would not recommend posts by him. Translation: ‚ÄúI bought the shit outta this dip. Everyone else needs to start buying now so I can turn a profit then dump. Thx‚Äù According to all specialists out there, BTC is supposed to hit $100k this year. Or 120k. Or 500k. Or go back to 30k and experience another 3-year winter. 

I mean, these people are all over the place. I can come up with random numbers too, and use random data to justify it, but the reality is that we have no idea how far this is will go in terms of value. People posting Tom Lee confirms the bear market..  fuck..  He always pops up when people are desperate. That guy needs to shut the fuck up cause he doesn't know shit and these dumbass posts need to stop, too 100k is a good target for 2021 What a bear Well we will see. Lee! Lee! Lee! Lee! Lee! poop site In another, unrelated news, Tom Lee is balls deep in BTC and is tryna save his own ass Lol Tom lees predictions are trash Brought to you by.....someone who wants to sell it to you at that price Fuck Tom Lee he's always wrong Tom Lee: Bitcoin hit $100k. Bitcoin ends 2021 at $7k After being in the crypto space for ~3 years, I‚Äôm absolutely certain Bitcoin will hit $100K. I‚Äôm also absolutely certain it will hit $15K. Unfortunately, non of this information is of any use to anyone because I don‚Äôt have a clue to when. Well let‚Äôs roll! Haha he has a heavy bag of btc bought at 65k üòÇ I could believe that Bitcoin range this year could be between 100K and 10k.

Thank you Don't ever foget that news about crypto are most of the time paid by groups of people who manipulate the market. Saying bitcoin will get to a certain price is dishonest because no one knows what the price will be because for the most part it doesn't depend on us. Bitcoin could have a natural value but you have to add on top of it the manipulation. all these people pulling numbers out of their butts...

Check the Stock-to-Flow chart, it's all that matters.

In this case, Tom Lee might get lucky and be correct. Bitcoin went bust. It was bought out by the exact people that it was designed to be against. It‚Äôs a useless coin, with insane fees. There was high hopes, but it ain‚Äôt going to 100,000. Anyone who WAS interested in Crypto isn‚Äôt going to bitcoin. They are going to a coin with a solid future that can‚Äôt be swayed by technoking. To communities that are filled with healthy discussion, not this censored cesspool. [deleted] I think history has shown to do opposite of what Tom Lee says. PLEASE PICK UP MY HEAVY BAGS This guy has been wrong year over year, not sure why still CNBC still talking to this guy about bitcoin. Tom Lee is the smartest investor in the world right now, IMO This is based on....a wild guess. Billions poured out. Real money doesn't wanna risk losing 50% overnight. Sorry. Dreamland is over Tom Lee, a man who has consistently made up figures, is still doing what he does best. If you believe anything he says, you‚Äôre just giving into confirmation bias. [deleted] Yes agree. I've not for one second considered the idea that this will stop Bitcoin from hitting $100k in the near future, though I think it could possibly take until early 2022 now cuz we'll probably spend the summer just building back up to $60k. Long term bull market is still very much on, we're just transitioning from the first stage of it ($10k-$60k) to the second stage of it, and it'll probably take like 6 months for this sideways-crash-buildup transition phase to take place, and we're about 3 months in right now.

Like I've been thinking since about December, this cycle will likely be a super cycle rather than closing out a 4 year cycle and starting new one. And we'll go up in large steps, with multi-month mini-bear markets in between each step. First step/stage was $10k to $60k. That has finished and Bitcoin looks likely to have bottomed at $30k. Now the market spends some time accumulating and building $30k - $40k as an unbreakable floor the way $3k-$4k was two years ago. Then second half of this year and likely into early next year the next stage will probably go up a bit past $100k before institutions start getting wary of the price again, new investors pile into shitcoins pumped my market manipulators instead of buying bitcoin and the few other good coins, mass FUD spreads and calls for the top of the market escalate and then it'll be time to drop again and flush out the market during the first half of next year. This'll continue as bitcoin and crypto continuously expands and opens up new markets and corporations and investment firms continue to gradually buy more Bitcoin. I expect this whole decade to be like this. Think we could see roughly something like $100k gains per year starting in 2022 or 2023 (gradually lower percentage gains throughout the decade as it gets harder and harder to move the market up by insane percentages) with mini-bear markets like the current one keeping things healthy and flushing out the market once a year or so. It won't be smooth in real time, but when you span out your point of view to the entire next decade I think we'll see a fairly smooth line upwards on the charts showing the 2020's super cycle.

Also, i think he over count the zeros.. should be one 0 less ok This article got a typo lol.... ""Bitcoin holders to get their reword very soon""  - reward...The author can't even type correctly. but why Yet people are afraid to but because the price is too low now. When it‚Äôs back to 60k the same people will FOMO straight in Oh god no. He was wrong in 2018. I wouldnt trust and outlandish claim. Just buy and wait 2 to 3 years. Hmmmm, does he even own any BTC? üòú tom lee is my boy. This guy is as qualified as I am to tell you the price of Bitcoin. His historical predictions of BTC are laughable at best. Seems like a hint dropping. Guess I should hold with these diamond hands In case you haven't seen it, this was his breakdown / prediction of price from 3 years ago. Was one of the main inspirational videos that made me dive down the Bitcoin rabbit hole!

Wtf is that? 73 to 80k than crash this guy has been wrong many times in the past, in the previous bull run as well, all the predictions are usually terrible 200k* I think he is low balling 
But after bull there is bear
What is the price signaling bear are at the gate? K he bought the dip and now wants the pump? more news at 11 What a moron. It's gonna be much higher than that. Does anyone on reddit have any idea just how much shit i will talk if this happens? This guy make many incorrect predictions before Delete this please! NO WAY! Noobs. Attached to feelings and someone else saying something. Get the fuck outta crypto, if you can't use your head. why buy land when you can hold btc Random bitch says Bitcoin will do something fantastic.
Cool Blast from the past. I predict Bitcoin will hit 50k again despite the current drop.

&#x200B;

So who's more credible now? This man has never been right about bitcoin. Although he has always been positive about bitcoin. He said $50k 4 years ago. So maybe he‚Äôs right, he‚Äôs just 3-4 years out. And I have the potential to be the richest man on earth, yet here we are, what is this even saying Yes please Somebody bought the dip Tom Lee back at it again.  When he is making predictions like this, you know the bear market is right around the corner.  Blowoff top confirmed. Still peddling the same old shit Mr Lee. in 2017 he said btc could easly reach 75000$. Am I the only one hoping for another big dip so I can scoop up some more?

Just my opinion. Robinhood will release a wallet in the near future. They‚Äôre working on it.

I've been comparing Fuller's work to Bitcoin for a while now Very interesting. And it actually makes sense. For instance, if it took 40MWh to produce a car, then you would need to have expended 40MWh of energy yourself (to produce some other good, like a Bitcoin) to be able to afford the car. Not quite. Energy isn't easily moved in time or space, and isn't easily stored is large quantities. Energy isn't money, and bitcoin isn't Energy.

Energy does play some role in bitcoin timestamp servers, but ultimately bitcoin is just a commodity, a money commodity.

The answer to the problems of state fiat are solved by free markets, with the value of bitcoin free to inflate or deflate naturally as needed by the market?"

Obviously this isn't new, we've seen similar things before though more focused on exchanges now the focus appears to be on mining.

Supposedly China controls 65% of hashrate:   [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1200477/bitcoin-mining-by-country/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1200477/bitcoin-mining-by-country/)

I've been keeping an eye on global hashrate:  [https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)

It's showing hashrate down to around 140mm TH/s out of a high of 180mm (-22%).  If my pseudo math is correct, we'd see it drop to 63mm TH/s if all Chinese miners just stopped (yes this wouldn't happen as they'd just start moving but this takes time).  And what's interesting is we are starting to see a (very) small rise in hashrate once again.

So here's my point.  What if China capitulates?  They come to the conclusion that Bitcoin and other forms of decentralized finance are here to stay (and will only grow) and that they must not cede their share of the industry dominance.  I think we're at an inflection point here guys and it'll be hard for them to hide their final decision.  We will either see the hashrate continue trending down as miners spin down and move their operations to another country -OR- they'll capitulate and form a policy of fostering this emerging market.  Now wouldn't that be a hard pill for them to swallow?

Either way, exciting times.  I personally feel that a Chinese capitulation would catapult the price of Bitcoin up however I would almost prefer they cede (mining related) dominance because I see Bitcoin as a form of libertarian ideals.  Not something China is well known for.";0;

356;Bitcoin Will Hit $288,000 | PlanB, Creator Of Stock-To-Flow Model Explains Why;nk080f;530;1621869155.0;maketherubblebounce;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG9f9n48ybU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG9f9n48ybU)

With over 25 years of experience in institutional investing, PlanB migrated his skills over to the world of cryptocurrencies, creating Bitcoin‚Äôs famous Stock-to-Flow price predictive model. Praised around the world for its stellar accuracy, PlanB predicts that Bitcoin will hit $288K or even higher during the current cycle. PlanB‚Äôs confidence in the model is so strong that he believes the leading cryptocurrency is more likely to reach $250K or $300K than it is to plateau around $100k during this cycle.";43;"This article agrees with my bias, therefore I shall believe it and promote it heavily. lets get this 288k going this year over the weekend FUD city and today rainbows??? Seems fishy still buying the dump not the pump here Which means Im withdrawling at 278,000 I believe it, because that‚Äôs what I want to hear, baby! So bullisht. I am all in with my savings. Most people wont be able to handle the accumulation phase. I'm skeptical. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt pump without dupes thinking they‚Äôre gonna get rich. 

Sorry guys we are not going to 8x in the 2nd half of this year. We might make an ATH if we are lucky. 

If you‚Äôre in it for the short term just remember this game is zero sum. I posted this elsewhere, but not too long ago PlanB was doxxed. It sucks that he was doxxed, but the doxxer revealed that he was just some junior staff at an investment firm, not someone with ""over 25 years of experience in institutional investing"".

PlanB did not actually refute this claim, and only denounced the doxxing act itself. And why would he actually condemn the fact that he was doxxed unless the doxxer was accurate in his doxxing. It would be different if PlanB said, ""LOL! That's not me, you idiot."" Instead, he was more like, ""You filthy doxxer. You're a very bad person.""

Make of that what you will. According to the s2f model from just a few weeks ago, today's price is basically impossible so I think the entire model is probably wishful thinking.

Also, the ""shortage building up"" has a big, fat IF attached to it.  There's a shortage building up IF people want to buy BTC.  The whole thing seems based on the assumption that Demand stays strong which you can't assume.  That's simply unknown. I want to believe BTC has too many paper hands to reach that number What does ""the current cycle"" mean? No. One. Can. Predict. The. Future. 

Regardless of patterns or fitting the model or historic highs and lows. 

Stop believing in this voodoo. I want to believe, but I think the fallout from Covid is going to cap it to ¬£100k. 

I think institutions have bought, and are in the process of buying, and it‚Äôll all appear on their balance sheets shortly. Retail will have another go, but that will be later in the year. There‚Äôs definitely going to be another run but I think it will get hit by the global fallout of inflation and interest rate rises.

I‚Äôm hodling and buying more. I just can‚Äôt see how the market cap can ballon like that while a global pandemic is going on. And then stay inflated when the rest of the world economy is on fire. > creating Bitcoin‚Äôs famous Stock-to-Flow price predictive model.

He didn't create the stock to flow model, he just applied it to Bitcoin. Yea anyone who follows someone who predicts prices is retarded. Whoever this kid is he is just clickbaiting you for $. I hope it reaches 10k so I can buy the dip. Dead cat bounce says no ? He extract data frm his own fucking node.

Damn genius S2F is a scam. The charts never have a Y axis labeling, and simply stretch the S2F line arbitrarily to lay over the bitcoin price. There is not labeled correlation. Stretch it as big as you like.

The only correct correlation is on the X axis, which is time based, and valid for both plotted lines.

I'm bullish on Bitcoin but at this pace I really don't see it hitting even close to that during this year. the good thing about plan B model is that we can have better night sleeps, like religion, its a faith on these models makes our minds calm but come on, when the model deviates they can adjust and say its on track... its like any TA, pareidolia, delusion and the willing the model can actually do something.

its not popular opinion but I do think this is all bull crap but a good one because if it coincidently works will be good, if not, well no problem because they can adjust the ratios over and over again until the reality become more accurately represented in the model... üòÇ

358;[Question] How to tell where my Bitcoin was mined?;nkxj0x;3;1621969837.0;NoAutoPilotYT;"With all of the talk around ""Green Bitcoin's"" I'm curious if there is a process in place today to know where your tokens were originally mined. I appreciate any help, thank you!";6;"Bottom line: You can't tell the geographic location where they were mined, nor can you tell who mined them nor what type of power their mining rigs were connected to. There are no coins or tokens on the protocol level. Unlike physical coins or dollar bills in your pocket, on bitcoin there are only transactions or UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Output). What this means is that there are only transactions with certain denominations being sent on the network, and addresses show the balance associated with that address, and the history of (transactions from/to) that address.  

If we want to make an analogy to the physical world, it's like taking a coin, melting it down to a liquid form, and minting a new coin again. Some forms of transactions have multiple of such coins as input, and multiple of such coins as outputs (batched transactions, coinjoin transactions).  

The output might the same value as the input, but it's not the same ""coin"" anymore.  

So it's kinda silly to try to find out where your ""coins"" have been mined because there are no coins existing in the first place. Or if you want to argue that there are, then it's like they are being melted down and re-minted with every new transaction involving those coins.

And that leads to another question. Does it make anyone else uneasy that during this correction the majority of those selling where retail investors and the majority of those buying (not anywhere close to even by the way) where whales? It‚Äôs the same old story...the suits suck up all the assets/money without regard for the ‚Äúlittle guy‚Äù, digging a whole that we will never be able to climb out of. 

This is not FUD.

The big players who sell those product will loose money when many retail investors gain. So they try to move the market to the max pain zone (read up about the max pain zone if you don't know what is is). Be very carefull when using this kind of products. 

Go for the real deal and get the coins in your own wallet. Honor the smaller profits (which still can be huge) and avoid getting rekt. Be safe. It's just pure greed.  You want to juice your gains to get rich even quicker but it just makes you lose everything that much more easily.

Yes, it would help somewhat, but using a platform that has your personal information is already a part of the game lost. Coinjoin wallets just help unlink the addresses/transactions associated with your identity, but the exchange and any other third party they share this information with will know that you have x amount of bitcoin and that x amount went into a coinjoin wallet. They might not know which transactions out of that coinjoin wallet are yours (if you take care not to mix coinjoined with non-conjoined coins, that is, see also ""coincontrol"" here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cjp2h9/crash_course_in_bitcoin_privacy_incl_reading/) Like another redditor said, it's already a lost game once you've KYC'd. Privacy and KYC just don't mix. Sure you can keep coinjoining/whirlpooling til the coins are completely obscured, but someone still knows you bought X amount of coins initially. 

What you should do from here on out is just make a separate wallet where you only buy non-KYC coins through P2P means. Maintain two wallets and don't mix them up. I'm interested as well.

But from what I know it will cost more fees... If you did something like that you probably wouldn't want to send the full amount from the coinjoin to the other wallet. It would be pretty easy to identify that the owner is just moving around funds. You would want to send smaller amounts to multiple receiving addresses at random time increments."

The only constant is Bitcoin. Hardly any altcoin survives more than a few years. People that are crypto Rich today mostly have two things in common.

This is a snapshot from coinmarketcap.com 4 years ago. How many coins from the top 50 are still around today?

https://web.archive.org/web/20170530035321/https://coinmarketcap.com/ This is only the beginning of Bitcoin. But do what you want and invest wisely! I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep if I held more alts than btc Altcoins will lose 95% in the next bear market. So be aware. You could always just use a little BTC and not all, maybe like 10-20 BTC and hold the rest, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being diversified just don‚Äôt jump into and stupid shitcoins like cumbombassrocket or whatever. You can do whatever you want, just don't regret it later. I recommend you use USD to buy altcoins. It's ok to diversify but the goal of diversifying is to keep a sizable portion of the steady value asset.   


Keep a lot of BTC, if you can afford to don't sell any and just invest more money into the altcoin market. Those gains are attractive but they also come with sizable dips. They're harder to recover than BTC as well as they normally pace their growth on whether BTC is doing well first.   


Alt-coins to me are good for day trading potential, but if you keep your money in them you're either doing long term gambles or losing out on the steady growth of BTC. Don‚Äôt mix the two baskets / ventures.

- BTC is (for many) long term store of value / investment.

- if you wish to dabble in speculative investments into alts, use separate fiat fund and manage it (mentally) separately.  But do understand the ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù goes both ways, they could swing higher but also fall much lower, and as others have said, can and do go bust. TELCOIN"

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey. It's pretty simple.  I can tell you what actually works the best right here.  

First: ""TA"" (tech. analysis) is pure bullshit.  

Second: Buy Bitcoins only.  Do not buy other ""cryptos"" -- most of them are pure scams, and the rest aren't much better.  

Third: Never sell.  Buy and hold Bitcoins, **long term** and with strong hands.  Be patient.  

That's it.  Do you know what ""strong hands"" means? Why would you only learn from one source? He can't scam you if you don't send him any money or coins. Is he charging for his course? when you say scammer, what has he done? if he is teaching you about crypto and not selling you other stuff or teaching you how to scam i cant see why you shouldn't continue to learn what you paid for. I think courses about (crypto) investing should really be avoided; at worst you get scammed, at best you learn about ""signals"" that really only benefit some few big fish who have a keen understanding how most smaller trained fish (you) would do e.g., technical analysis, and behave in the market.

In the context of Bitcoin you often hear about the seemingly simple investment strategy to just buy and HODL. I'd advice to seriously try to attack this strategy - attempt to come up with historic counter examples, look for any current developments that would invalidate the strategy (e.g. what needs to happen that Bitcoin price would go down long-term), look at the articles of [EndTheFUD.org](https://EndTheFUD.org),  a.s.o. Invest a couple of hours for a few weeks - get a feel of it. Imo this is much better learning than doing any online course. Read ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Standard.‚Äù It‚Äôll all become clear there is more then enough free super useful information about crypto on youtube.

almost all ""gurus"" are scams, he might have just stolen the content from someone else. There is only one way to invest cryptocurrencies:

When the users are identified, taxation and regulations are enforceable. Not straight from the wallet, but there isn't much hiding space either. With enough capital, the market is up to manipulation from big hedge funds. Am I wrong here? Is there anything I am missing?;5;"i have been wondering the same as OP, Bitcoin seems more traceable and trackable exactly because it supposedly aims to be transparent - where it can be tracked back to the blockchain, plus with more KYC in Western countries to support tax collection and stop money laundering Bitcoin seems as accountable and compliant as the Fiat world for the non-institutional investor or ordinary person now. 

It does not seem very independent from control any more, but can see how it would have seemed a chance for that in the past. 

I am scared even confessing these thoughts will unleash a torrent of downvotes here.

I understand in theory Bitcoin crypto is supposed to be non institutional, non custodial etc, but in practice now it does not seem it can be anymore, if participating where KYC and tax obligations apply, that is all. When Bob Smith pays Sam Jones with a check, then Bob's banks know all about as does Sam's bank, as well as others.  Bob's home address is on the check, too. No. So first of all, the Bitcoin transactions are not tied to your IP address. The bitcoins are tied to you because the exchange does KYC. 

Even if you can hide the Bitcoin, when you spend it on stocks, a house or some other things, the tax office sees that and will come and ask you where you got them funds. Look on Google about getting paid in Bitcoin, and you‚Äôll see what the tax dangers are there when you don‚Äôt declare it to the tax office. 

And on another note, what‚Äôs wrong with taxes? I‚Äôll assume you are from USA, since there are the taxes so hated. Taxes pay for roads, for police, for regulations and for teachers. You like your democracy, right? You know what can kill democracy? A bunch of stupid people. Pay your taxes, so that your countrymen get educated, so  that you can keep your democracy. Make sure the news outlets are regulated so you and your countrymen get non-partisan news so that you can keep your democracy. You can use VPNs to hide your IP address and there are solutions that exist and others being developed to assist with blockchain privacy.  Bitcoin magazine has a lot of guides, including this one I found: [How to Use Stonewallx2, a Privacy-enhancing Bitcoin Transaction Tool From Samourai Wallet](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-use-stonewallx2-a-privacy-enhancing-bitcoin-transaction-tool-from-samourai-wallet).

I need your help for my thesis. I am searching for participants for my online survey. Please fill out my questions.

\- it takes 15 mins

\- anonymous

\- You will make a student very happy

Since I need people who actually invest in cryptocurrency, it is hard to find someone in my personal environment.

Thank you a lot!

[https://campus.lamapoll.de/Bachelor-Thesis-survey](https://campus.lamapoll.de/Bachelor-Thesis-survey)";6;"I filled in the survey. 

I'm probably a participant that is of interest as I have 90% of my net worth in BTC, but I had the feeling it was not aimed at me. Mostly because of the terms used in your survey. Like: ""trading strategies"" I'm not a trader. ""Your online broker"" I don't have a broker ""In which cryptocurrency do you invest?"" I'm not a investor.  ""Your trading strategies"" what? etc. etc.

I don't think I'm investing. I just feel safer in the long run about holding Gold and Bitcoin instead of Euros. Since 2016 I ""dollar cost average"" like a lot of other bitcoiners independent of any market sentiment. I don't have a trading strategy, and I will never sell BTC for fiat. 

I have the feeling this survey is only intended for speculators and traders and not people that believe in Bitcoin for the long run... Done and done. Good luck with the thesis! Done, good luck! I really appreciate your effort! Please answer the survey! Happy to help! :) Bitte"

To my fellow Bitcoin holders. I have been a member of the community since the 2013 BTC bull run. I started off in Fintech at a Top 3 BB. I have dipped my toes in IB, PWM, and Blockchain research since then. This past Friday I was told by an individual at the Director level at my firm had a meeting with Janet Yellen‚Äôs team about the future of Bitcoin and Blockchain tech in the short-term. He informed me depending on my entry that it would be my best option to drop anything in my crypto portfolio with ‚Äúhigher priced positions.‚Äù The United States Treasury currently is poising bitcoin and other digital currencies as a large threat to FIAT and will endure heavy regulation and taxation (potentially more than capital gains on equity securities) until a sustainable U.S. backed CBDC can be developed. This broke my heart and my hopes for Altcoins and Bitcoin to eventually be as widely accepted as fiat. As a member of a community that has been so good to me, I owe this this favor back to the many of you that helped that were so helpful along the way. I wish you all the best. Thank you for all you have done.

388;"""Bitcoin crash opens door to a tax loophole for investors."" TLDR: Basically, you could have sold in this crash, suffered a loss, and use that loss to reduce or eliminate capital gains tax on winning investments. THEN: BUY BACK BITCOIN!";nlelp1;1;1622028252.0;Jethroe1;;12;"And whats wrong with this ? Bob buys 1 BTC at $60K. Later, Bob sells 1 BTC at $40K. He just happened to have capital gains on other investments, so Bob reduces this year's cap. gains tax by TAX_RATE * ($60k - $20K).

Bob immediately buys 1 BTC for $40K. Later, Bob sells 1 BTC for $150K. Now he must pay cap. gains on $110K profit, instead of $90K profit (which he would have realized had he not sold at $40K). ""POOF"" goes Bob's ""tax break.""

Sounds like Bob complicated his taxes, likely flagged the IRS to audit him, paid exchange fees to sell, exchange fees to re-buy, plus transaction fee to send his BTC to the exchange. Bob had to take a chance that the LTCG rate would not increase between the time he ""reset"" his BTC cost basis and the time he sold it. Bob is shaking his head, saying, ""Not worth it."" This makes absolutely zero sense break down :

CNBC :

1. you bought at the top
2. then they say you sold at a loss or got liquidated due to leverage
3. now they say people are using the capital loss to bring down their yearly income for tax time. (witch would be true)
4. then they say you can now purchase bitcoin again right after you sold at a loss...

the whole thing is just retarded and assuming you bought the top and sold at a loss...

CNBC you guys are trash at reporting on crypto, to me it just shows how retarded/broken the taxation system is. Wrong. In the 30 day window, btc could moon and you miss it. Bob should have moved to Puerto Rico before cashing out. I‚Äôd rather sell and invest my gains in an OZ and defer and offset that capital gains tax bill If you exchange btc for stablecoins is this taxable? It's not fiat gains?! tldr; Crypto losses are treated differently from those of stocks and mutual funds. This is because so-called ""wash sale"" rules don't apply, according to financial advisors. Investors can sell crypto for a loss and then use that loss to reduce or eliminate capital gains tax on winning investments.{}

It always is and always will be. Until a majority of the bitcoin is on the hands of government and the banksters

Never forget you people owning any bitcoin is a threat to their power.

The moment they get a majority, all the suddenly bitcoins PR issues will go away. A vast majority of financial markets is based on propaganda. Successful investors study human behavior and psychology for a reason. Wait you guys sold? Musk and Saylor are probably on a private discord server laughing at all of us. There is more truth to your post than most will realize.  I'd guess your portfolio is in pretty good shape thinking the way you are. Yes, they did manipulate the market and they will do it again.

Besides ignoring it and HODLing, what are we supposed to do? Question, any idea why ""they"" stopped at 30k? I mean, if they have the ability to push it down to 30k, why not 20k, or 10k? Excellent essay from Michael Goldstein back in 2014: [Everyone's a Scammer](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/everyones-a-scammer/). There‚Äôs only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins, think about that. How far will whales go to rip them from our diamond hands? Buy with money you don‚Äôt need right now, DCA and for fuck‚Äôs sake stop listening to the boogey man stories and fucking hodl. It‚Äôs that simple. You don‚Äôt even have to be that smart to see it. What's the matter? I just bought more, so cheers out to them! hodling and buying every month for 150$ like always people who get shilled out of bitcoin doesn't deserve bitcoin. I bought 0.025 bitcoin at $35k. Am I doing it right? This was an assault on weak hands, not the first, not the last, maybe orchestrated, probably not.

It's really easy:

1) Don't buy more than you can afford to lose.

2) Don't sell your Bitcoin ever or until it reaches some number you predetermined in the cold rational light of day would be your target.

3) Profit. Damn those people!!!  for (checks notes), putting bitcoin on sale for a while? I‚Äôm holding out of sheer obstinacy. How is Saylor going to turn on us?? i agree with your post 100%, and i hate it when they call it ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù, it was obviously a full crash created by a coordinated attack and market manipulation, i‚Äôm more than sure more than one of the whales sold to drop the price, created fear through media, made the price drop more and bought back in at 30k, this is a prime example of why you should hold, and not be obliterated like the weak hands. Here‚Äôs a secret, buy when they buy then u don‚Äôt have to worry Former executive director of Goldman Sachs: cryptocurrency market will grow 100-200 times TLDR - hold during flash crashes, buy if you can. Start holding some extra cash for just these occasions. Take profits when the bull is charging. I will keep stacking forever regardless of what other people do. However, I would be very disappointed if Michael Saylor betrays us. They actually don‚Äôt want your coins they just want the fiat profit. The will creat fud to get cheap then they will promote to sell it to you when you FOMO. Repeat üîÅ same circle Yep.  Elon's flip and future flop was clear as day (called out even by Bitcoin mainstayers on Twitter when he did the energy FUD).

Michael Saylor has always been a shill who, on 20-30% dips, tweets ""MS just bought the dip!  100 new BTC @ $50k...*for a total of 100****,000*** *BTC at $23.5k, don't read that part plz*"".  Let them do them, but nobody should be following them unless you are included in their meetings. It was an assault on weak hands. It would take a lot more than to take out Bitcoin. Why would saylor buy at almost 60k then if he could just wait for the dip that he and his guys orchestrated? Isn‚Äôt this just a natural part of having a decentralized currency? It‚Äôs like y‚Äôall want it totally free of regulation but also completely impervious to market forces. 

It doesn‚Äôt work like that. when we lose money it‚Äôs a conspiracy but when we make money it‚Äôs because we are smart. Got it. Hear hear, do not bend the knee! 1 BTC = 1 BTC I think you mean they couldn't care less. Dontcha think it‚Äôs a little early to be calling the bottom? I feel really mad that nobody asked for my consent before they fucked me and my Bitcoin. And I swear to fuck, this literally started the day after I bought 75,000.00 in Bitcoin ETFs.  fml

I then bought another 75k at 3 points during the dip. Federal Reserve Bostic: cryptocurrency and digital currency are areas that the Federal Reserve cannot ignore. The characteristics of cryptocurrency and stable currency market make it impossible to be classified as currency. Fukn A  ! HODL till the cows come home. Those greedy bastards aren‚Äôt getting one red cent of my coin. What's the tea on Saylor now?? I mean, they tried to assault my bitcoin. Didn't really do anything though, still have the same amount Yeah just now after elon started tweeting positive about btc again its even obvious to me too.

The whole thing was planned to bring the prices down, fill the sack and then bring the prices back up.

Ugh We have tried to tell people to just HODL, tried to tell them to look at history and the 10 times it happened previously. If they still sell at a loss then they deserve it. SO what your saying is buy the dip? > could care less

The expression is ""couldn't care less."" couldn't* care less Be individualist, make you own choices ! Couldn't care less*

Could care less means they actually do care, which is the opposite of what you are trying to say. Bought the dip for 10k Buying every dip, never selling, thanks for the FUD, I bought more.

Who cares? It will rebound. It‚Äôs not over yet. If this ever goes up to new all time highs, then I‚Äôd say the game was rigged. LOL. Sorry, of course it‚Äôs rigged and perhaps the solution is not Bitcoin it‚Äôs a reset of governments across the globe. While Elon didn't help matters the crash is mostly a China play. Goldman Sachs and the ""council"" aren't moving the market; GS is desperately trying to prop BTC because all of their Wealth Management clients are excorciating them getting them into an instrument that dropped 45% in less than a week. Unless you were planning to sell or you actually got shook out (from leverage or being scared), you shouldn't care. I think its fine to find a role model. A friend you trust could turn on you. End of the day, you will have to grow a spine and decide who you want to follow. You don't know shit about Michael Saylor Who is margin. Why does he keep calling Most people are selling 10-15 years too early anyway It's honestly been so long I'm not sure I would know how to sell even if I wanted to. just hodl don tworry Well we need to orchestrate a bear trap... like now Couldn't care less* Well put.

Cup and handle my ass if you ask me, you need to look at the lastest headlines in the media to know whats going to happen to bitcoin. you can also go check out [https://cryptoquant.com/](https://cryptoquant.com/) to check out the flows of bitcoin in the market. maybe take a look at bitcoin treasuries.

you could look up the latest SEC fillings even.

dont be that guy that tricks himself into thinking he predicted the market with crazy pet names for each chart movement. (charts cant predict tweets)

401;Questions from my friends. Need your help to answer them properly.;nlg26j;7;1622032897.0;Responsible-Ad8221;"Hello sub.

I‚Äôm pretty sure I am able to call myself Bitcoin ‚Äúpreacher‚Äù because I would like to spread the ‚Äúword of wisdom‚Äù among my friends and colleagues. Of course pretty much everyone have already heard about BTC but my mission is to: 1. get people familiarised with BTC 2. get people involved with BTC. Long story short, some of my buds finally got Binance accounts, some bought hardwallets, one of them is mining atm.

The problem is - I frequently bump into 3 facts that I can‚Äôt deny and look stupid during debates:
1. Transaction cost. 20$ is way too much.
2. Transaction time. Sometimes every minute counts.
3. Awkward transaction system. Misspelled 1 symbol - BTC burned. Wrong protocol - BTC burned. No disputes, no chargebacks.

My best shot is that BTC is not fiat and doesn‚Äôt support ‚ÄúOne latte please‚Äù yet.
Maybe someone can enlighten me with better counter arguments?

Cheers!";7;"Everyday transactions are not for btc. Its more like gold. You wouldnt  buy a latte with a piece of gold. Transaction fees are there for validation, makes the system secure. Also it's a long term investment. 20 dollars to send something doesnt matter when your portfolio worth 4x as much or more in the long run When you buy a latte with Venmo or a credit card, no ‚Äúmoney‚Äù actually changed hands in that moment. There is simply an entry made into a database along with millions of others. Banks and other large institutions periodically settle these millions of transactions all at once in very large transfers amongst themselves. In this way, Venmo and your credit card may be thought of as payment layers built on top of the settlement layer. 

Bitcoin is the ultimate settlement layer. It is not economically efficient to use bitcoin to buy a latte for the same reason you would not use a cargo ship to transmit a single package from Amazon. But it you put enough packages on that ship, at some point it does make economic sense.  

For everyday spending, bitcoin requires layers. The lightning network is a decentralized, user controlled example of a layer you can use to buy latte today with negligible fees. There probably will also be centralized payment processors offering credit card type services but settling in bitcoin.

It is accurate to say that the base Bitcoin layer is not suitable for latte purchases, but that is because Bitcoin is not a payment processor - Bitcoin is money. Visa, Venmo, PayPal - these are payment services, not money. > Transaction cost. 20$ is way too much.  

Where does $20 comes from? Use a proper wallet which allows custom fees, use low fees.  

If you are talking Binance withdrawal fees, then that's not bitcoin's fault. It's Binance fees, not bitcoin.  

>  Misspelled 1 symbol - BTC burned  

False. Bech32 addresses (those starting with `bc1`) have a checksum, and a proper wallet won't send to a mistyped address.  

> Wrong protocol - BTC burned.   

Most other coins have a completely different address format which won't be recognized by a bitcoin wallet. Some forks of bitcoin might have, but I'm not sure if, again, a proper bitcoin wallet won't handle that. In any case: you need to pay attention to what you are doing. With great power comes great responsibility. About transaction time, it's generally so much better than fiat. If you've ever moved large amounts of fiat to invest in stock, you would know that it generally takes days to happen. And all traditional markets are only open for a few hours during the day. BTC is slower than fiat for daily transactions, but it's so much faster (and cheaper) for large ones. And it's 24/7.

It's also quite unlikely to misspell a public address as they contain a checksum. You'd need to get multiple characters wrong _and_ miraculously get the checksum right for your coins to be sent to the wrong address.

As for sending to the wrong chain, it's just a matter of asking the recipient to send it back. Most exchanges will do it for you if you ask nicely. Layer 2‚Äôs like the Lightning Network solve 1 & 2 ‚Äî cheaper fees and fast tx‚Äôs. ultimately its a SoV you wont be spending btc on coffee (tho possible with LN). as far as no. 3 - uhh, *be careful* Stop trying to convince people. I was this bitcoin preacher back in 2016. My friends laughed at me and compared me to the bitconnect Carlos guy. Look at me now, swimming in gold."

405;British banks finance 805m tonnes of CO2 production a year;nkjtbc;16;1621927431.0;kihikihi;;5;"tldr; The amount of CO2 production financed by Britain's banks and asset managers is nearly double the UK's annual carbon emissions, according to a new report. The study, published by environmental campaign groups Greenpeace and WWF, shows the City provided loans and investments for projects and companies that emitted 805 million tonnes of carbon in 2019.

This is pretty funny, especially as The Guardian keep publishing negative articles about Bitcoin using too much power. They're generally pretty good IMO, but their environmental articles are often misleading and cherry picky.

So this is 1.8x the UK's annual CO2 emissions, and that's just *investment,* not even including the CO2 emissions of the world banking system itself.

The last anti bitcoin mining article was claiming power usage greater than Argentina, who use 121 TWh. UK used 304 TWh in 2016. 

Of course it's difficult to convert TWh into CO2 weight, but it puts things into perspective, and is just one example showing how this narrative of ""Bitcoin bad because too much powwaahhh!!"" is total bullshit when considering the full picture."

408;Why did Satoshi Nakamoto even use an alias?;nlyn06;27;1622086387.0;warmachine0609;"I'm sure lot of papers would have been published that threatens to replace the banks. I wonder how this guy knew that his paper will change the world decades later.
Or does it further reinforce your belief in time travel?";32;"Intelligence. Foresight. [Here's an absolutely fantastic article](https://leung-btc.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10) that posits the late Len Sassaman was Satoshi Nakamoto, and suggests that their choice to remain pseudo-anonymous was born of a cypherpunk hackivist desire to keep the person from eclipsing or compromising the ideas.

> I wish you wouldn't keep talking about me ... maybe instead make it about the open-source project and give more credit to your dev contributors No leaders no heroes. 

From the people to the people. 

Do it yourself, do it for free. 

Simply put, Satoshi's desire to change the world eclipsed the desire to be famous. Satoshi wanted to eliminate the attack vector on the founder and so removed his/theirs identity from the equation. Bitcoin is in essentially destroying the banks and taking away their power. Banks don‚Äôt like that and my guess is that if they knew who Satoshi Nakamoto was they would have killed him, without a doubt. Satoshi would be in jail or dead if he did not use an alias. He didn't want to become a target by governments and he wanted to avoid being seen as some know it all ""shadowy figure"" so the power could be in the hands of the people. Because he was possibly involved in the 90s cypherpunk movements and learned from their (or his) mistakes. He is not targetable. Yet another gift from Satoshi. Satoshi Nakamota is a fallen angel? Even I keep my identity and finances private from my friends and family. It's smart of him/her/it/them to do so. everyone uses a alias online. You used the alias Warmachines0609 instead of your real name. Bc Satoshi is an alien When the banks got bailed out back in 08-09, he/them decided it was time.

Glad he/they did. So he could say FU in private. He solved a very small problem of human trust building using technology. Satoshi is Hal finney >I wonder how this guy knew that his paper will change the world decades later.

Well he knew a decade ago what you start to understand now.

The system was already very sickening in 2008, it just takes a lot of time for people to understand how bitcoin can help. He understood (or at least hoped) bitcoin would work. Somehow she just knew How do you know it's an alias? The anonymity allowed him / her / them to step aside and let it flourish.

It allowed people to step in to the void and let the decentralization to grow. Because using an alias reduces the chance that people point the finger at an individual or group of individuals and reject the bitcoin premise and thesis based off natural human prejudice and biases. 

""This thing can't be good. It was made by a black man/ China man / Afghani / etc."" - racist prejudice.
 
""This thing can't be good. It was made by a woman"" - gender prejudice
 
""This thing can't be good. It was made by a homosexual/ trans gender/ etc."" - homophobic prejudice
 
Etc etc. Because it isn‚Äôt one person.... it was an intelligence agency. Any idea why they used ""we"" in the white paper? If he/she/they where known it would be easy for the banks to use their common power plays to undermine the projects value.

Like; ""look at this (inser insult) who made this. Because this person did so and so in the past, this project cant be trusted blablabla"".

Media is ran by money, so they can easly use it to force an opinion onto the masses. Devide and conquor. it's gonna be hilarious if in 20/30 years he come out and says that he was a hedge fund manager all along. Because he understood what system he had developed and part of the opportunities that lie within it. Too much for a single person to carry this as a responsibility. No way he woulda known he would change the world, he was probably just a shy fuck who probably ended up dead or now its too late to admit he is him. By being mysterious he made crypto about the revolution and not about a person. He did the best decision. He also holds like over 9000 coins so he made himself absurdly rich I think Elon Musk is a great example of why Satoshi was right to remain anonymous. Having a single person with too much influence is harmful to bitcoin. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to be entirely democratic because that's how the best ideas come to fruition. Undoubtedly, we would all trust what satoshi says over most other developers/community members, which would lead to biases creeping in. 

By remaining anonymous, there is no clear figurehead or leader to take charge or create biases. There's no single person who can be discredited or slandered to cause damage to bitcoin. It's able to stand freely and allows the technology speak for itself. Craig wright is the creator of the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamato. Read something reddit. It's really that simple. Satoshi is musk Because Kevin Flynn was too American..."

410;I'm new to crypto;nlxb6q;1;1622081635.0;Boosted-ws6;I decided to buy $800 worth of bitcoin when it was at $55k. I'm not planning on selling it anytime soon, even if it does get back over 55k. But realistically what is the ceiling for bitcoin?;15;"That‚Äôs such a future macro question that anyone who try‚Äôs to convince you that they are right also has some free whole bitcoin for you. $800 ain‚Äôt gonna make ya rich in 10 years anyway, keep buying in whatever you can afford if your plan is to hold. Looks like the price is gonna steady here for a while, which is good long term. Shows that people are holding and the longer it holds steady, more and more people will feel safer to venture in. Starting 3 months ago, I started putting 35% of my salary away in crypto each week and I haven‚Äôt looked back. I have bought in at 33, 34, 36, 38, 42, 44, 46, 48, 52, 54 and stopped. But then started buying again when it dipped back down to 33k. Now that it‚Äôs low again I‚Äôve been steadily buying my weekly usual. A lot of this is uncharted territory. There is a ton of potential, but also a lot of risk. But if you ask me, the benefits of crypto and its potential far outweigh the risk. IMO, we will see $55k again and more. You can‚Äòt guess a ceiling. Fiat won‚Äòt be staying for good, therefore you can‚Äòt meassure it anymore in a shitcoin named $. 1 BTC will be worth 1 BTC in near future. Just hodl There is no ceiling BTC to USD, in theory could go to ‚ôæ It goes up forever Laura > $55k

ouch. welcome to crypto. best to just to just log out and revisit your $800 in a year Nobody knows. But if you read the bitcoin standard you may start to see the possibilities. Who the hell knows bruh. You bought in under 60... How much money do you think when it's over 100,000? Welcome to the future. no ceiling just floor Technically, there is no ceiling due to the hard cap. Bitcoin has infinite value potential, whereas fiat has infinite amount potential.  


Theoretically, the ceiling in relation to the global standard currency Dollar is the entire amount of Dollars divided by the total amount of Bitcoin (assuming Bitcoin consumes the entire global standard currency, which is very very unlikely)  


Realistically, nobody has the slightest idea. It is all a guessing game. So do what you feel is the best. If you did not invest more than you are willing to lose, HODLing is actually quite fun. The ride is stimulating since there is always happening things in Bitcoin. It is not like Fiat which is like an old lady trying to cross the street. Bitcoin is the street.

I guess you're begging their permission because your ""current holdings"" are their money  

Earn your own money. Invest all of it any way you want

> I have high belief in bitcoin

Blind faith is not a substitute for knowledge  
But you should invest anyway, learn how easy it is to be fooled 
Always diversify. You are still young so your risk tolerance is still high.

Getting rich is a bonus but the investment goals always should be to have enough funds for emergency, saving towards bigger potentials like starting a business, tuition for advance degrees and ultimately to retire with ease at your target age. 

So it really depends on your starting point you should develop your plan accordingly. Check this twitter thread, may be a good place to start your research. https://twitter.com/Breedlove22/status/1141567060847149056 Make a deal with them that they have to pay you back the difference if they are wrong hahaha You don't need them to get bitcoins. Just do it make sure you keep your seed words safe. Don't tell them how much your getting either. BTC looks like a scam to a lot of people right now.  It‚Äôs being portrayed as a ‚Äúget rich fast‚Äù scheme, and that‚Äôs not the case, if you‚Äôre in it for the long run.  Show them that you know the difference between YOLOing and investing.  The volatility makes it difficult to rationalize as a solid investment for some MILLIONAIRES... So, if the guardians aren‚Äôt cool with it, you‚Äôre pretty much out of luck.  

While I am 100% in favor of you owning BTC, it will require an account to be set up by an adult.  So if they‚Äôre not on board, you‚Äôll be pressed to find a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù way into the space.  However, with the popularity of BTC increasing, some banks are starting to offer it to their customers... perhaps you could have them help you open an account and just buy through the bank.  

Or...

Save as much as you can until the next halvening and YOLO into a few nice dips. tell them you will be able to buy designer boxes of Depends for them when the time comes that you have to powder their asses and change them.

sorry Asia and Europe selling again like usual. :p https://bitcoin-only.com/learning-resources Most boomers wont even think outside their comfort zone. Regular jobs and fiat money is past due, we are now in a new epoch where things resilient to change are not just economical and political structures, but also mind structures. Even if you show them evidence of being prolific or making them realize that some coins like TITS coin supports charity, or maybe if you tell them that many people are wealty or are able to sustain themselves just by making smart moves in the market, they would still prefer regular works and fiat because they will still think the same.

Bear a little more, save money and make smart decision like not getting involved into useless parties that would take your money apart. Ask them to provide you a written list of why it is a scam or go over with them and you write out the list. Once you get that list it will help you better understand their objections.

If they're open to discussion I would probably sit down with them and watch some decent Michael Saylor videos (without much/any music or goofy edits) after giving them some idea of his background and explaining he owns a business and got involved in Bitcoin due to seeing the future depreciation of their cash reserves. Then some recent pro Bitcoin articles/interviews by rich people and respected businesspeople. Try to meet them where they're at not so much bringing them to your level."
412;PSA: Nodes have more control over the protocol than miners;nl0ijh;143;1621978089.0;Zyntra;"I see a lot of exaggerated reactions to the news that some rich folks are talking about some green mining cartel. It leads me to believe many here don't understand who decides what makes Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin.

The gist of it is this: if they want to self-impose some rules regarding mining (more specifically: the energy source used), let them go ahead, because it won't have an effect on the protocol level. 

Bitcoin is the term used for many different parts of the Bitcoin machine. It describes both the ecosystem, the token, the network, the protocol, etc. Bitcoin is not something straightforward, which makes it so difficult to explain in layman's terms. Rather it is a balanced act of several different concepts, technical, economical and political.

The role of a miner is very different from that of a node. Unfortunately many here fail to understand this difference and attribute way too much power and control to the miners, while it is in fact the nodes that ultimately decide what it is we call Bitcoin. Attempts by miners to assert control over the blockchain have happened in the past, and they did not end in favor of the miners. Any attempt this time around to assert control through politics and legislation won't work either. 

Any miner can decide which transactions to include or not include in his block. But one single miner can't mine all the blocks. If the green mining cartel on the other hand decides to fork with their 'clean version' of the blockchain, whatever that means, they are free to do so, but they won't have an economic majority behind them, which means they will lose money, because they don't get to decide what Bitcoin is, nodes do.

tl;dr run a node, read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos, chuckle at this meaningless green cartel mining crap, good night";17;"> The role of a miner is very different from that of a node.  

My shot at explaining the difference:  

Imagine a person who is going into a gold mine to search for gold. That's a miner. Now imagine someone who wants to acquire that gold from that miner. The buyer wants to check that the gold is real, so they come up with a device that can check this within a split of a second. That's a full node. It can check that the bitcoin is genuine without trusting the miner or anyone else.     

Miners = work for bitcoin and provide security to the network  

Full node = checks that miner's work is genuine and there hasn't been cheating In marketing terms,

Nodes = customers

Miners = service providers

A service provider certainly has the power to not work for a customer, but that's all the power he/she has, and at the cost of not earning the money from the said costumer.

A customer decides where his/her money goes. If a service provider doesn't work in a way he/she likes, he/she can simply go to another service provider who does work in a way he/she likes.

The same happens in Bitcoin. The miners work for the nodes. They have to work by the rules set by the nodes. Whatever the case is, my node supports Taproot and is a full node. I‚Äôm doing my part. Firstly the consensus rules define what bitcoin is. However there is no governance body for bitcoin that defines the subjective mapping of the set of consensus rules to the name ""bitcoin""

A more accurate statement is that economically significant nodes have the most control over the protocol, among other groups like the development team.

To say ""nodes have more control that miners"" is a very ambiguous, self fulfilling statement - given you are using proper definition of miners and nodes.

A miner is a entity that creates new blocks and extends the blockchain, given a set of consensus rules. **Therefore a mining node \_is\_ a node**. **Miners need to run the bitcoin node software or they are \_not\_miners.** If you are just running an ASIC you just a hasher that works for a pool, basically playing the role of AWS if a person decides to host a bitcoin node on the cloud. AWS is not running the node - its the person controlling the software but AWS is renting their compute power.

However, **mining pools \_are\_ economically important nodes** and have some influence over the protocols direction certainly more than a non-mining node belonging to a person with less than 1 btc.

Nodes controlled by exchanges, mining pools, block explorers, light wallets and the core developers, large holders, economically active holders are economically important groups that have influence over the protocol.

While its true bitcoin is not ruled by miners, they do have significant influence that should not be understated and dismissed trivially.

Mining decentralization is very important, we need more of the 'hashers' to become miners by switching to Stratum 2. Frankly we should be DDOS all the mining pools that don't use it...

[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin\_is\_not\_ruled\_by\_miners](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_is_not_ruled_by_miners) Thank you. So many plebs on here have no idea about the real power dynamic in Bitcoin. Everyone is losing their shit like miners and hashpower actually have influence over the protocols. People who know about the UASF are not tripping at all. Just sitting back eating popcorn and hodling. they have different power, not more. no single constituency has unilateral power in bitcoin. Not sure what you're even arguing here. this was, to my understanding, never about imposing any power on the bitcoin protocol/network. this is a bunch miners imposing rules on themselves and trying to convince (!) others to follow their example - nothing more, nothing less. and ultimately, it's a good thing, because it changes nothing for us, but it does change the narrative about the evil eco-killing bitcoin that's going around lately. what stops someone from spinning up 10000 nodes to fake activity and have majority of nodes too. Just curious Uasf I'm not sure what green bitcoin would even look like considering most of the tokens were mined years ago. Not all nodes have the same value. If you mean nodes from popular wallets like Coinbase, then yes. If you mean that regular people‚Äôs nodes have more value than miners you are wrong. Wait are you telling me that a majority of so called Bitcoiners only bought into the NgU without giving a flying fuck of wtf is Bitcoin? OMG. Shocking. A node also has full authority over where they are in their own blockchain, and which chain of blocks from the other nodes they accept over others. If someone starts to do something fucky, it would be known, and any node willing to fight the attacker can just deny their blockchain entirely. Golden post Miners dont control shit over the consensus rules Thank you I hope this post stays at the top for a while. Shows how many do not understand miners vs the people running full nodes who make the rules. Man I hope so."

True. Okay, people. Everybody here let's get those 6 bitcoin and hodl. And watch what *real* scarcity means for supply, demand and price, LOL. I have .02 bitcoins. I'll leave the maths up to you. I‚Äôd say about Tree-Fitty I have about \*.\* btc. I spent around $35k. After the dip, I'm about 30k in profit still. Hoping btc hits 200k bc then I'd sell the .\* to pay off student loans and then hodling the \* for my future. I'm 30 years old. I shitpost a tonne here and if my holding was average then there‚Äôd be well in excess of 6 million coins held by all sub users group-think has tons of power, same goes for wsb Check the survey done a while back regarding how much they invested in crypto. Most was under $1000. If you take that to be a random sample of the population, that would mean most people hold 0.025 if BTC was all they held. That‚Äôs 75k btc for 3m subs. I wouldnt know, but the level of activity probably inverses with the holdings, meaning that people with more post less and vice versa. Reading some of the comments got me thinking like this Reddit page owns not even 1% ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Let‚Äôs figure it out‚Äî I think I own around 0.0000007% of the total.

Okay, next person‚Äî I think it would be really strange to be a whale and not be subscribed here so I would assume the majority of Bitcoins are owned by people here. Whether they bother to check the sub I don't think so. I would guess about 1 million in total, people that actually have money probably have better things to do than shitpost here. I‚Äôd guess between 300,000 to 500,000. There are definitely many whales on here, but they almost always just lurk.

I can say this with full confidence because I've seen many OG bitcoiners go dark during bull markets that made them rich... Yet if you speak with them they still know what's going on in reddit and BT.

My guess is 90% of the whales are on here... And the other 10% are over on r/BitcoinMarkets because they aren't freedom lovers or even believers in the tech, just lucky traders. I have 7 coins, so assuming everyone else also has 7 coins, then I would say 21 million.

Edit: /s im sure many of the people here who are invested, are somewhat diversified in a number of coins the average over all btc in existance is damn close to 6.15 I might have almost same amount of satoshis. lol I have 0.05btc but its leveraged There are probably multiple account holders not wanting to be doxed as hodlers- so probs subtract at least a third I'd say around 500.000 BTC

I'm sure there are some whales lurking around. My question is: When is one considered a whale? 4% Not even 1%. Shout out all my satoshis brethren. Isn't there a 1 BTC club or something like that for people that hold at least one? Someday maybe I can join. More than r/btc In since 2017 20 I heard someone comment on BNN Bloomberg that Twitter is where most go to ""discuss"" bitcoin
It used to be reddit but now it's Twitter 
My guess is I would be surprised if it's less than 5% of all btc if you count everyone who has read at least 1 comment on this group there‚Äôs 100-150M btc users so i‚Äôd say not much overall How much BTC to be considered a whale? I have 1btc There are 21 million Bitcoin"
419;How I significantly increased the routing income of my lightning node with charge-lnd;nkwc9n;28;1621966688.0;crushfetish;"So, I've been running my [lightning node](https://1ml.com/node/033719864ecae30f766a05f84dc74a88af6a268c5b8289e6b31bad4d9e635f20de) for almost a year now and already wrote about my experience and what I've learned in that period [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/mneews/my_experience_running_a_lightning_node_for_10/).

In that 10 month period I\`ve only earned around 1000 satoshis and used the default fee settings lnd comes with (\~1 sat per forward).

Luckily there is a program called [charge-lnd](https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd) that automatizes channel fee settings based on a policy or combined policies defined by the node operator. I run charge-lnd in a linux cronjob every hour to ensure charge-lnd refreshes policies in case channel liquidity changes (by a routing event)

I am still in the experimentation phase with charge-lnd and have been using it for a month so far, and it yielded me around \~1400 satoshis since the beginning of this month so far, which I consider a huge success.[Here](https://pastebin.com/73dKBFya) is the policy that I have been using with the goal to let charge-lnd almost auto balance my channels and keep them more or less proportional -> to avoid frequent and costly manual rebalancing.

I am in no way an expert with charge-lnd policies and just combined a few which I thought make sense for my nodes context. I would be happy for others to share their experience with charge-lnd and maybe even share some configs.";2;1000 sats. Wow. Here's me thinking I'm Larry Large with 28 sats in routing fees this month.

420;What does mining mean?;nlqzbm;3;1622061739.0;ClownToyWhiteface;Hello there. I'm new at bitcoins (or cryptocurrencies in general for that matter) but I heard about mining bitcoins and other cryptos. It sounds like getting cryptocurrencies through a procedure but I don't know what it means, can you help me out?;5;"Bitcoin is based on a technology called a blockchain. A block is a compiled set of all the transactions that occurred within the block time (about 10m for Bitcoin). These blocks are placed one after another in a chain, hence the name, which can be thought of as a timeline of all the transactions that have occurred since the chain started (the genesis block).

In order to create the next block a miner needs to collect all the transactions they want to include (up to a maximum data limit called the blocksize). This combined set is then run through a 'hashing' algorithm which takes all the data and outputs a certain number. This is where the crypto part of cryptocurrency comes in. The hashing algorithm is a one-way function, it is easy to put in a data set and get out an answer, but practically impossible to work the other way and get the data from the hash.

In order for a block to be mined successfully the output of the hash must be below a certain number, and the odds of the transaction set (or any other input data) producing an output that meets this criteria is infinitesimally small. Because of this the miners do not just calculate a hash once, but instead try millions of times, tweaking the input data slightly through the addition of a 'nonce', which is just a number thrown in to ensure the hashed result is different for each iteration.

The more computing power that is dedicated to this task the faster a hashed result that is lower than the limit would be found, so to counteract this the difficulty is increased in proportion to the hashing power of the miners on the network, thus ensuring that the block time remains (fairly) stable. Eventually a miner will try a nonce that leads to a successful block creation. They publish the nonce that was used and all the other miners can check the hash by running the block though the hashing algorithm with the number the successful miner has found, whereupon they should all get the same result. The miner who found the correct nonce is rewarded with some bitcoin (or whatever currency is being mined), the block is added to the chain and the process starts over again. 

The reason people talk about the wasted energy of bitcoin is that while each hashing action is easy, it has to be recalculated vast numbers of times before a solution is found. Each of these takes computational power and therefore electricity, and the amount of them that are instantly discarded without any tangible benefit is astronomical. People talk about bitcoin mining as solving difficult maths problems, but that's not really correct, the problems are very easy to solve but they just need to be done a huge number of times. It's more akin to rolling hundreds of dice until you get straight 6s... not really a complex task but a very repetitive one.

The fact that this process is very energy intensive is bitcoin's security. If someone wanted to mess with the chain they would need to solve the block themselves. If they wanted to mess with a block that was already in the chain then they not only have to recalculate a nonce for the block they want to change, but then also all the blocks that have been added since... in fact in order to catch up with the current block you would need more hashing power than all the other miner's combined. When you work out how much this would cost, it's not as much as you might imagine, but is at least well outside of the average hacker's budget (https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nf4911/how_easy_would_it_be_to_make_a_51_attack_happen/gyjnzjy/).

Anyway, I hope that makes sense, I tried to explain it in a newbie-friendly way but obviously look up anything that isn't clear. Also, if you're from the UK, feel free to chuckle at the choice of word for the **N**umber used **once**... Bitcoin miners receive Bitcoin as a reward for completing ""blocks"" of verified transactions which are added to the blockchain.

without miners theres no one to process transactions. Some really good videos on YouTube explaining the process of mining in simple terms The start of this video explains it quite well:

What if I start endlessly trading money between two wallets with an automatic algorithm. The chain would DRASTICALLY increase in size. 

If someone evil thinks of this idea, it will be a huge problem.

Edit: go fuck yourselves";21;"Tell me you don't know how something works, without telling me you don't know how something works. If you are not afraid of transaction fees - you‚Äôre welcome!

EDIT: actually if you would like to make chain grow exponentially you would need WAY MORE transactions than you could ever imagine. You‚Äôre an idiot. The original 1mb block size cap (which practically doesn't exist anymore today) was introduced to prevent exactly that attack scenario (spamming transactions). Since the blockspace is scarce, you need to pay fees for every transaction that you are making, and even if you manage to fill up a full block with your txs, the only thing you'll achieve is that you'll make a miner very happy.  

Blocks are already full btw (because blockspace is in demand), so your transactions will need to pay quite a bit of fees in order to compete with other people's transactions, and it won't achieve anything, as it will be the exact same growth rate for the blockchain as it is right now. You would pay for that. The room in the block is limited exactly for this reason (cheers BCH shills). So if someone wants to send meaningless spam transactions, they can. But they would pay for each and every one of them, and miners would still pick only the transactions with higher fees, so people who actually have a real need to send a transaction would simply pay 1sat/b more and your spam transactions would linger in the mempool for two weeks after which they would be ignored. You are not the first one to think about it, it happens quite regularly. And the spammers always lose. I've filled the paperwork for your Nobel Prize. Will you be having the beef or chicken at the ceremony? It always amazes me the low regard people give computer engineers. No, you haven't though of something that people who literally build your world have not thought about. The point of the fee is to pay for the cost of doing transactions. You will be paying a lot to do what the network is built to do. Yeah good luck with that buddy. Hope you have a super computer and millions for transaction fees No. Each block contains 1MB. The blockchain increases at a rate of 1MB / 10 minutes. Nice try though. No, but you did just figure out how to destroy every other cryptocurrency that thinks they can provide an open, decentralized blockchain with low fees. I'm also new to crypto I have some similar ideas... such as sneaking into the bitcoin factory and mixing up the blocks. I'd like to see them stop that attack Please take the time to read [this](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUhY2xKDLQSnxoePE1R94NdDTjuNuYgKv2cXUdW9gxGQL). If you are new . All these problems you  can think about have been asked many times during these last 12 years.

Thousands are trying to crack bitcoin blockchain and they all fail.

It s not a little chnock like me and you who will crack bitcoin tomorrow and drive  a lambo. Maybe start by reading the Bitcoin whitepaper. There's something mentally wrong with people who go around attacking things they know nothing about. This is why block space is limited. The size of the chain grows at a constant predictable rate. Transaction fees vary according to demand. You can send as many transactions as you want as long as you are willing to pay the fees, but spamming the network in the manner you describe is unsustainable. This was one of the major issues in the block size debate resulting in the BCH split in 2017. The spamming technique you describe could pose a threat to block chains attempting to scale through block size, but it does not threaten Bitcoin. It's not only hardware development countering this, there are also possibilities like slicing and sharding a ledger. If you know how the chain works, you can also certainly see that argument that you can for practical purposes only work with the last few years of the chain instead of havin it all. So you could make a (lot) of backups at every 5 year mark and keep them somewhere just as they are, just in case, and then work with only the last 2.5 years of what you backed up, discard the rest.

Remember, the more blocks are added the more you can be certain it is the ""correct chain"". So if amount of transactions per day explode, it will become more valid to work on even smaller slices of the chain. Of course you still need to be able to look back, sync etc, but there are algorithms to do that. That's how you destroy the big blockers and literally the reason why Bitcoin keeps block size small. So yeah this works on many other crypto, but not Bitcoin Thank God you're not evil! Now this, this is real comedy."

I have the etherscan transaction from Celsius, and it shows the right amount. I have the binance deposit etherscan link, and it shows the wrong amount. I tried to trace the path between the two, but at some point I end up in one of [Binance.US](https://Binance.US)'s hot wallets so the path gets buried. If you're really good at etherscan, msg me and maybe you can help me figure out where the $100.00 went.

I wrote to [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) support, and I kid you not, they came back saying that gas prices and USDC prices fluctuate, so I shouldn't receive the same amount of USDC I sent. I understand USDC fluctuates against USD, but that's not what I'm talking about here. I sent USDC, Celsius paid the gas (I wrote to them and they confirmed it was sent correctly), but at [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) I got a different USDC deposit amount, and it's off by precisely $100.00 USDC.

428;A Proposal: 100 ‚ÄòBits‚Äô to make up 1 full Bitcoin;nlf9te;1;1622030486.0;Tweldorian;"I am frequently frustrated when explaining to new BTC inquisitive people that you don‚Äôt have to purchase a full Bitcoin, to own Bitcoin.

They complain that the widely publicized price of Bitcoin is just too expensive for them to ever contemplate buying Bitcoin - or bother learning about it.

To make matters worse, when I further explain that 100,000,000 Satoshis make up one Bitcoin, their eyes glaze over because that all just looks like unwieldly difficult math to them‚Ä¶

**\*\*\* Possible solution \*\*\***

Everyone understands the Dollar, and the 100 cents that make up one dollar, right?

So, why not have a Bitcoin with a divisible unit where 100 of them make up one Bitcoin, say:

**100 ‚ÄòBits‚Äô to make up 1 full Bitcoin?**

That would then mean 1 Satoshi would be a micro\*\*‚ÄòBit‚Äô\*\*, or a millionth of 1 **‚ÄòBit‚Äô**.(Again, easier to understand the diminutive size of 1 Satoshi, compared to 1 Bitcoin.)

\*Most people own a small fraction of a Bitcoin, and I often see people aspiring to reach ownership, of say 0.01 or 0.1 of a Bitcoin.    
In this proposal, wouldn‚Äôt it sound and 'feel' better, if they could celebrate that level of ownership as, say, they have  1 ‚Äò\****Bit‚Äô*** *or 10* ***‚ÄòBits‚Äô*** *of a Bitcoin, respectively?*   
*(like owning one cent or 10 cents, in the case of a Dollar)*

At the current BTC price (approx. US40K), 1 ‚Äò**Bit‚Äô** of a Bitcoin would cost US$400 and I think that it would be far easier for new people to consider investing $400 in BTC to own 1 'Bit"" of a Bitcoin‚Ä¶ and with more people buying, it would mean greater demand - and price..   and I like using **‚ÄòBits‚Äô** as the unit for the many obvious and easily relatable reasons.

*What do people think?*

Apologies if this has been suggested, before, but I think this Bitcoin/Satoshi value and huge numerical divide is an unnecessary hurdle for many new people to bother overcoming.";18;"We have mBTC and ¬µBTC, self explanatory and easy to use. All wallets support it and most exchanges and charting software.

No need for any arbitrary new unit that needs do be defined and explained every time.

This has been discussed a thousand times already in the last 10+ years and it has been explained a 1000 times why this idea is nonsense. No. Sat is the standard. I dont want to sound too harsh here but just because your familly and friends fail to understand basic math, doesn't mean we should modifty something that is not broken.

Basically there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin or less right? So in this scenario where you make bitcoin LESS divisible and still keep its scarcity.

What you say seems all good right now because you can sort of afford 400$ but if money keeps flwing into bitcoin and the market cap keeps growing, the min entry price will too.

lets put bitcoin at golds market cap of 12 Trillion dollars for this example because thats a very possible future. (flipping gold as a store of value)

12 000 000 000 000 market cap / 21 000 000 bitcoin supply = 571,428.57$ per Bitcoin .

so now the smallest amount you can get to even just get SOME bitcoin is 5,714.28$

1. there would be less transactions happening on the chain so less fee's for miners?
2. you made the coin less usefull for the masses
3. anyone in the world use to be able to buy bitcoin now you need 5 grand minimum
4. poor people can no longer use bitcoin as a store of value.
5. you are assuming 400$ is not a lot when most people dont have 400$ to invest.

it would be a disaster for the poor people who love bitcoin. the idea of being divisible 100 000 000 time is that no matter what the price is, anyone will be able to get some even with 1 cent.

even with a 20 T market cap and a million dollar bitcoin, 1 cent can buy you some. Everyone disagreeing with OP, but if we ever get to the point where things are priced in BTC, it would be nice to have something between a SAT and a BTC. I had a similar idea back when I started and wanted to call 0.01 Bitcoin a Bitcent. Never picked up obviously haha Why?

Everyone knows what fractions are‚Ä¶
Those which don‚Äôt know for sure have other problems.

Dont make it even more complicated‚Ä¶ Like it, love it, gotta have it [deleted] centibits Other cryptos are not divisible.

Try to explain crypto to them with that.

But again, it's just basic math.

Divisible by 100 or 1000000; it's just a bunch of zeros.

They best way to learn in my opinion is to just try it out. that would be cBTC or bitcent, though micro and milli are more common and probably make more sense in the long run. what you call ""bit"" is another name for micro bitcoin (100 satoshi) - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Units If what‚Äôs stopping you from buying Bitcoin is your understanding of fractions all you‚Äôre doing by buying Bitcoin is losing your money and contributing to volatility. Nope, can't use bit because it's already a unit of measure for data. It would be like mixing meters with pounds. If people don't want to understand Bitcoin that's on them, and that's okay This reddit spent about 2 years arguing about this in 2014-15 and no consensus was ever reached so we gave up. This honestly makes it sound like you don‚Äôt totally understand Bitcoin either. Yes also lets call a hundred dollars one stack Those unwilling to understand basic math, probably have paper hands."

Control your money supply first. I wonder if they‚Äôll ‚Äúprint‚Äù more than 18 million digital Canadian dollars... ""Those same computers are also running around the world to update Bitcoin's decentralized ledger so transactions can happen as easily as two people exchanging a loonie.""

""He said the central bank wouldn't need to build a similar kind of trust in a possible digital currency because Canadians already trust the Bank of Canada and the bills it prints."" Maybe i stead of focusing on new control mechanisms, we can work toward the greater good! Renewable energy!!! Have your cake and eat it too... It's like they literally cannot wrap their heads around why people don't trust the monetary authorities no it wouldn't. it would require an army and a violent regulation regime to back it. and it wouldn't be open to everyone, censorship resistant, or borderless. it would also be an orwellian surveillance mechanism of state power and population control. not sure what green means, but if it's green, it's also drenched in red. A bank is a bank is a bank crypto or fiat. Exactly what we stand against. All more centralized solutions use less energy than proof-of-work. This shouldn't be news to anybody. Are these fucking idiots ACTUALLY trying to capitalize on the ""greenness"" of Bitcoin, or lack there of, to bolster their own digital currency? It's almost as if they don't even get the entire point of what Bitcoin is, which is NOT a CBDC that these idiots think they can popularize. As if being green is the point... they are desperate to continue to trick the normal populace into believing money is OK the way it is. Just because you ""digitize"" it doesn't mean it magically takes on the properties of a hard currency like Bitcoin. Infact when it's centralized and under their control it actually makes it far worse and outright evil.

435;Conversation with a financial advisor;nl13id;147;1621979764.0;MrSelf-Growth;"My brother-in-law is financial advisor and I wanted to see what he thought of crypto.

Well, it turned out I got him triggered. Here are some key points he brought up:

1. You don't have 1 BTC so you don't technically own it...
2. I manage to get 12% return every year to my clients, which is better than the S&P 500 yearly returns!
3. Look at this Visa card, this is exactly the same thing, digital payment!!
4. I am managing million-dollar portfolios and you're here trying to tell me how finance works!?
5. This is a big pump and dump for big banks and Elon!!!

Aside from the fact that he reminds me of old people when the internet came out, here are my takes:

1. We are still early AF;
2. People have biases, including myself. But he just couldn't admit that something could disrupt the way he would do business;
3. The average Joe still thinks that crypto is just Bitcoin and that it has no utility;
4. Never, EVER, talk crypto with someone who's tied to the conventional financial system;
5. HODL.

Crypto will change the world in a good way IMHO. 

Cheers to that!";48;"A Visa does not store wealth. It only stores debt. ""You don't have 1 BTC so you don't technically own it""

Clearly he hasn't even the most cursory understanding of Bitcoin.  He probably thinks that it's a fractional stock.

But yes, we are still very early. i told my co-workers i bought bitcoin at 6-7k CAD and they laughed at me like I was crazy.

now most of them are into crypto. 12% yea, right. Did you ask him if that includes his fees? ‚Äú1btc technically you don‚Äôt own it‚Äù. That‚Äôs pure nonsense. I can buy fractions of a btc and move it to any wallet I control. That‚Äôs ownership! This happened to me in November and he was trashing bitcoin when it was 19 000. I told him he was gonna eat his words lol >I manage to get 12% return every year to my clients, which is better than the S&P 500 yearly returns!

Imagine getting 12% a year üòÇ Reminds me of the Dave Ramsey episode where the guy was asking Dave whether or not he should sell his BTC, worth a substantial amount. Dave responded something to the effect that he didn‚Äôt think the guy would be able to actually ‚Äúcash-out‚Äù. Then when on to tell him how he was gambling lol. I‚Äôm pretty shocked at your in-law‚Äôs first comment, but maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be so surprised, we have some serious teaching to do! 
Your poor sister. You have a crappy relationship with your brother in law, lol 12%? We eat that for breakfast in this market! STop your crypto narrative please.

You have to learn that bitcoin>""crypto"" yourself too.... I am a FA. There is a lot of resistance in the industry to defi and crypto in general, because the industry has had a period of a rising average age.

Don't take his lack of understanding and empathy for a condemnation of the industry: with all the regulations in place, its nearly impossible for us to give our clients exposure to crypto.  Hopefully that will change. I would say that if they can't imagine that cows, wampum, glass beads as a kind of  money, or Rai stones of Yap as a community ledger, or the silver certificates of the Great and mighty Khan as a debt promise, then they are going to really really struggle to understand bitcoin as money.

Because bitcoin is a money in another form. And they need to recognize money-ness when they see it. But.. sometimes a person's wealth depends on them not seeing it. >4: I am managing million-dollar portfolios and you're here trying to tell me how finance works!?

yes I‚Äôm financial advisor every single one of my clients owns gbtc at a ave price of .75 to 2 bucks 

Your brother in law is a dope I wouldn‚Äôt let this adviser manage my finance. He‚Äôs probably also triggered by the letters ETF because that‚Äôs not as profitable for him as the actively managed funds he wants his clients to buy into. I really hope you are making this up as nobody should be using that guy as an advisor. Ufff‚Ä¶.Ex-financial advisor here. A majority of the FAs I‚Äôve met are poorly trained, glorified-insurance salesman. Yeah my sister is a financial advisor. I got lectured when I was in my 20s a while back when I brought it up. It cost me hundreds of thousands bc I was gonna drop 1k which would be worth so much today. I don‚Äôt see why not to just dip your toes but to the traditional people, they‚Äôre very closed minded. Being a financial advisor does not make you an expert on crypto. I am an accountant in daily life, but not much of what I learned translates to crypto. (I can, however, calculate if it is worthwile to invest x amount in hardware with y energy costs with z expected return of crypto, but that‚Äôs about as far as it goes). Time for a new financial advisor who has a clue and not one who's looking for the best commissions. I am a financial advisor. Your brother-in-law is wrong. I‚Äôve been having a ‚Äúspirited‚Äù debate with a good buddy of mine for months now about bitcoin. Like your brother in law, he is an FA/FP and brings up nearly identical points you have listed

In fact, point #4 is almost word for word what he has said to me - as if to dangle his superiority over my head some how. Satoshi invented bitcoin, in part, to tell these people to go eat a bag of dicks. HODL your bitcoin and do better than the people who say they‚Äôre better than you. So simple, so beautiful. What's that quote?  Something like, ""It's very difficult to make a man understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it""?  Something like that.  He can't sell you BTC so he hates BTC.  It's literally that simple. I've asked 2 financial advisors about bitcoin, both of them pretty much said exactly the same thing damn near word for word. My best friend is a financial advisor and he's on board. It's, unfortunately for him, probably 80% of what I talk to him about. >I manage to get 12% return every year to my clients, which is better than the S&P 500 yearly returns!

i doubt that is true over a longer time frame.
in addition to that, he will collect high fees while an ETF is nearly free. For Planners worldwide - its an uncomfortable discussion.

1. their dealer group wont go near crypto - too volatile - I can understand them not wanting to deal with people if there / is major downturn,
2.  They want Crypto to die, so they feel nice and safe to keep throwing the same chestnut out the door - balanced funds, it will all go well over the next 5 - 10 years. Yeah and theres my commission !!
3. Planners dont really know anything about economics - they just spit any of the crap that comes from their dealer groups 
4. I do wonder if they wake up every morning thinking "" yep todays the day the shits going to hit the fan - here comes [carnage.com](https://carnage.com)"" In any event, it wont be their fault cause just about everyone will be stuffed 

cheers ! I cant believe people still make same mistake over and over after many people writing here not to tell anyone you invested into crypto....:/ I make my living through the conventional financial system.

Crypto will help fund my retirement. As far as what they teach you I could see why people are still skeptical. It‚Äôs hard to assign or even justify a value on something that doesn‚Äôt have an underlying cash flow or just generation of value. Fundamentally speaking it makes no sense. That being said I do see it as maybe a not so traditional store of value.  

Even though he comes off as an ass in point number 4  he‚Äôs kind of right I can‚Äôt tell you the amount of people who just barely started dabbling in investing while in a bull market all of sudden they become financial experts and it is pretty exhausting. Honestly you probably didn‚Äôt trigger him you probably just annoyed him. 
Imagine somebody coming to your job who has no experience and all of sudden he starts telling you how to do your job. 

As far as it‚Äôs legitimacy in finance as we probably all know it‚Äôs gaining more and more adoption.  I think they even added a section on crypto currencies in the test to get your cfa. 

The only thing That throws me off is I understand technically it‚Äôs a currency but almost nobody uses it as such. Everybody just hodls which is why I personally see it more as a store of value than a currency. I feel bad though that he was triggered like that. They are mostly salesmen for the funds they get commission on. That's not possible with BTC so they aren't going to educate themselves. Sounds like he is salty that he is a financial advisor and missed the big red rocket blasting off in front of his face as he was trying to milk another few points for some schmuck. Welcome to the club. I've worked in IT my whole career. Had the same argument when BTC was at $8k with my Stock Broker mate.  I just agreed to not discuss it with him to end the argument. 

People who studied finance or economics believe that their opinions of money trump all others. This may be true in the traditional investment sense, but there is a little Dunning-Kruger at play, because the truth is they have very little knowledge about the technology and the philosophy behind crypto. Those are bad arguments, from both sides. Sounds like you poked the bear bro haha People are going to fight something that threatens the world they are accustomed too. I have a cousin who works in one of these financial companies/hedge fund sort of thing and since telling him about my crypto, he just constantly sends me negative articles advising me to take all my profits and get out before it collapses. I thought it was me being naive. Sounds like convo's with my father-in-law.   
""Better off in a term deposit"" 200 bucks return after a year of like 7k locked away. Great.   
""It will be banned"" yep cause the governments are gonna ban the internet?  
""It is imaginary and has no value"" have you heard of literally any other asset that has value because the market deems so + has utility?   


I gave up a short while ago and decided to always have the reaction to anyone who asks, ""nah crypto, not in thatanymore. What do you think of it?"" and then listen and hear the same old stuff haha I'm not big into crypto, but I know the basics of it. I would not let that man anywhere near my money. It's perfectly fine if he thinks crypto is too risky an investment, but to be wholly ignorant of it is a red flag for someone whose job is to stay ahead of financial trends. It's funny because Visa and credit cards themselves are scams and should be illegal but our whole society doesn't blink an eye at this because the Bankers say it's fine. 

Credit Cards are like gambling, they feed on a persons instinct to want something, this is a scam to steal money from already poor people. It's like dangling a carrot infront of Horse. 

Credit Card companies and Banks know the poor and middle class can't resist not wanting to buy things with money they don't have so they issue you a credit card and then charge insane interest which compounds the more you buy. This littery digs financially illiterate poor and middle class people in a hole they csnt get out of as it creates an infinite loop of only paying off exuberant interest or missing payments which leads to more penalties. 

This is why it's hilarious for all these financial guru's un r/buttcoin and r/finance that say Bitcoin is a scam. You want a real scam?? You want a real Ponzi?? Go after the credit card companies but oh no we wont do that because they've conditioned our society that it's completely normal to have credit card debt. I wouldn‚Äôt trust that guy with a satoshi, let alone my sister. 12% yearly ROI oh boy! Crypto swings 10% on a daily basis, just holding bitcoin gives you on average just way more than 100% yearly ROI. Seems like you don't need to manage those fancy million dollars portfolios after all. When the car came out most people just wanted faster horses The big problem with bitcoin, which raises many doubts about its future, is that after 12 years it is still useless. Nobody buys it to do something with it. It is completely useless. And this could be a problem in the long run. Ya there is no such thing as Bitcoin trading. If you participate at selling Bitcoin for profit you a dummy. Same goes with mining. Stop."
436;Stop the conspiracy theory, the Bitcoin Mining Council is a Publicity Stunt to adress environmental concerns;nkiyxd;244;1621923988.0;Maercurial;"Basically, it's anti-FUD, doesn't support centralisation (because NODES quarantee decentralisation!) and is ultimately no different to some Mining Pool saying they're using green energy. Which is something that should be encouraged to silence the press bullshit and make Bitcoin more appealing to the concerned public. Climate change and green energy usage IS a big deal and if the public thinks it's a dirty coal coin, that's going to hamper adoption massively, like it or not. 

The idea that this would cause two different Bitcoins, one that's green and one that isn't and therefore is worth less, is at this point a weird conspiracy theory. There's ways to address that, like making Bitcoin more anonymous and less trackable, which should happen anyway (Taproot already does that, to an extent). 

Basically, if there's issues arising in the future, we can rightfully critisize them, but so far this is just good publicity and freaking out over it seems weird. 

tl;dr Bitcoin getting centralized because of this is FUD.";29;"Have you missed that some of those pools involved in that ""mining council"" [have publicly announced](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/30/2201996/0/en/CORRECTION-Marathon-Digital-Holdings-to-Launch-the-First-North-American-Based-Bitcoin-Mining-Pool-Fully-Compliant-with-U-S-Regulations.html) that they will be engaging in censorship attempts, and are marking [their blocks](https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000003f8cb66fe1ecfb38754abc9c4d4a62b71de45fef8777) as ""OFAC compliant""? Pool operators like that forming councils and cozying up to regulators *should* invoke attention and vigilance. It's not the danger of a fork that is significant here, the danger is the undermining of (or an attempt to undermine) one of bitcoin's most fundamental properties - censorship resistance.  

Now, to me it also mostly looks like a PR stunt and posturing right now. However, this is exactly the right time to call them out on this and create some awareness what is going on and what might be going on in the future. People are quick to forget the history, and too quick to cheer on leadership figures, as we've seen it times and times again. Bitcoin mining is, for now mostly, a commercial activity.

That ensures it will maximize efficiency that includes going for the cheapest energy, which happens to be excessive energy which happens to be often the most green energy.
Like abundant hydro energy (dams like in Chinese with excessive capacity), geothermal energy (like in Iceland).

It is going green by natural forces.
The whole energy discussion is a false one to start with since Bitcoin is the most, decentralized, energy efficient money system available.

It is all FUD... It is good to distrust everything, that's why we are here. Thank you.

For years bitcoiners refuted the ""China controls bitcoin mining"" fud, as if they were all working together, but a group of American miners get together and talk about using green energy and suddenly bitcoiners themselves start fudding.

The blowback on that Saylor tweet is f'n ridiculous. If he'd said the same exact thing without saying 'Mining Counsel' there'd be no drama.

I too see it as a PR stunt, one positive to bitcoin, as the energy consumption of bitcoin is nocoiner's biggest complaint. Exactly right.

A mining council is simply a way of legitimizing larger scale business mining operations in the eyes of government to report accurate renewable usage, and encourage further efficient adoption to avoid FUD like this in the future.

Bitcoin by its nature does not prevent you from joining the network due to the type of energy you are using. Burn tyres in your back yard to create steam to power your rigs if you want, it‚Äôll work, you‚Äôll just be priced out, as will other dirty sources eventually.

Any body that sets environmental restrictions for large scale mining operations, whether that be government or self imposed, will have zero impact on the protocol itself - the difficulty will adjust based on hash rate, and we'll get our block every 10 minutes. I think the thing people are scared of, is what if this is the beginning of some OPEC cartel. Think 50 years in the future, little by little A ""Mining Council"" is the antithesis of Bitcoin. Sure it is. But ""environmental concerns"" are an even bigger and dumber stunt, so I'm fine with it.

> The idea that this would cause two different Bitcoins

thats not going to happen - miners dont have that power. This thread was mentioned in an article on Bitcoin News:

> [**Crypto Proponents Become Skeptical of Closed-Door Meeting Between Billionaires and Bitcoin Miners ‚Äì Bitcoin News**](https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-proponents-become-skeptical-of-closed-door-meeting-between-billionaires-and-bitcoin-miners/)

^(I am a bot, bleep bloop. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwr_news/comments/ng4ab6/inthenews_bot/)) Look, musk is developing the fastest growing renewable energy + battery market. To think he doesn't plan to offer some amazing ""build you a renewable mining farm"" package would be silly. 
Totally about how he can profit in the short term to make mining better in the long term. It will be forgotten in 2 weeks Remember when Elon said BTC uses too much energy? Many show off their green mining rigs. But now when the mining companies have want to do the same, these same people don‚Äôt want to?? Miners are free to choose the pool they want to join so idk wtf these people want. Totally, it‚Äôs just a buzz word trying to make Musk‚Äôs idiot energy concern valid. When renewable or green energy are cheaper than the clunky ones, all miners will definitely use them. For now taking down FIATs at the cost of quite dirty energy is a good tradeoff even solely on environmental measurements. Completely agree. Let's relax. I've literally seen tweets fully speculating about what exactly the committee talked about/asked for and people are freaking out over that one person's pure speculation. This is good anti-FUD for now, especially since energy claims seems to be the #1 reason for the average person to hate on Bitcoin, it's fine to dislike the closed-curtain aspect of the meeting, but let's not go nuts with conspiracy theories and doomsday claims. 

Nobody should have been worshipping Saylor anyway, but there's also no need to assume he's some evil man here to take over Bitcoin just because of this. Dude for real. That pinned comment in the other thread was complete nonsense. I can‚Äôt believe so many people are taken in by Conspiracy theories these days. It's not a theory. Noobs like you weren't here during the NY agreement. THEY ARE CONSPIRING NOW JUST LIKE THEY DID BEFORE. AND WHEN THIS FAILS, THEY WILL CONSPIRE AGAIN.  THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER BITCOIN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOOB NOOB!? THIS IS NEVER ENDING FIGHT. I concluded the same, just a conspiracy theory flimsily based.

The masses, as always, get influenced by the 'fear' narrative of the day. This the standard 'gov wants regulations, gets people to scream bloody murder about nothing, gov steps in to save the day with new laws/regulations, then you won't hear jack shit about it.'

Just think of not long ago when 'Vaping is killing everyone, we need more laws,' then after some laws passed (which literally did nothing other than increase fees/fines for the industry) the problem magically went away and you haven't heard jack shit about it any more. >publicity stunt

Sounds EXACTLY like what a nefarious supervillain would say about his gathering of evil henchmen. FUD has no effect on centralization,creating blocks with only approved transaction and subject to government regulations create centralization.

It's a slippery slope and it's better not even start going there. You said this:

> because NODES quarantee decentralisation!

and this:

> The idea that this would cause two different Bitcoins

Do you not see the conflict between your two statements?  If miners do something bad, the only thing that nodes can do is reject those miners' blocks, forking the chain.

Now I don't think that this announcement is a big deal, but it is definitely a step in the wrong direction. Naive. That's the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is a prelude to something more sinister, and for those of us paying attention we are more then a little pissed. 

Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. How do i get on? Elon bought the dip. Well said, OP. Billionaires can do whatever it is they do, and sure, it might affect the market in the short-term, but in the long term it all comes down to bitcoin being a currency that cannot be fucked with. Whether people think so or not, it is the purest form of a free market that this world has ever seen. As soon as anyone seriously threatens the basic fundamentals of bitcoin, their bullshit will be dealt with and immediately pushed aside by the millions (and eventually billions) of people who actually want a fair, unfuckable currency. Steps are already being taken to make bitcoin more fungible, and that type of progress will continue as long as it needs to in order to ensure the basic idea of having a currency with no central authority and no possible way to devalue it. 

‚ÄúFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.‚Äù I'm not seeing many negatives.  Here's the positives:

1. Mining is almost entirely a for-profit enterprise, and a consortium provides a mechanism to standardize policies and processes that can serve to counter the energy FUD.  It also helps to legitimatize the industry and help control the narrative.  It's just part of Bitcoin growing up.  Now this all assumes these miners believe in the core values of Satoshi's invention of Bitcoin.
2. This is leading us more toward self-regulation which is infinitely better than government regulation.  
3. Though I think Bitcoin is already green, we're running out of fossil fuels anyway and the world needs to move to more immediately renewable energy sources.  (I say ""immediately"" because, in my mind, fossil fuels are a form of stored solar energy).  
4. If China does fully ban mining, which hasn't yet fully materialized (and I'm skeptical of), it allows mining control to move back to non-dictatorial countries.  I would definitely like to see those countries pioneer in decentralized fintech and the freedom/libertarianism it represents.  Mining and staking are key here.  
5. Tin foil hat time - Elon is no idiot and didn't suddenly realize how much energy is being consumed to mine Bitcoin.  Removing the Bitcoin payment option for Teslas was a publicity stunt with likely no impact to revenue (yes, it impacted their share price in the immediate term).   This is a classic problem-reaction-solution scenario and frankly well played as Bitcoin will probably be better from it long term.  Master of coin indeed.

I, unfortunately, have way more OFAC knowledge and experience than I'm proud of.  I've gravitated toward Bitcoin, in part, because of this experience.  I personally feel that using any form of money as a weapon is just COMPLETELY wrong.  Money should be completely fungible, apolitical, neutral and hold it's fracking value.  Unfortunately these values are extremely difficult to defend because money is power and power corrupts. I don't think anyone's super concerned about what Elon has to say, they're more worried about inflation and interest rates etc. A bit like how fast fashion companies have all these ""sustainability initiatives"" and ""conscious collections"" while they continue to produce 100 billion pieces of crappy clothing every year on borderline slave labour in poor countries, but it gets the media and social media to shut up and think it's all good so they can continue operations as usual? Hm...

Bitcoin at least is 100% more pro-human. This whole thing just sounds like it's setting a very iffy precedent for future regulations."

In order to know which transactions have happened on the network, a wallet needs to have a source for this knowledge. A full node is such a source. If you don't use your own node, you (your wallet) are using someone else's node, with all the implications for your privacy and trust assumptions.  

A full node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).

The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.

The way it looks to me from the outside - one day you can buy a new TV, another day a new car and on third day a portion of ice cream.";6;"Because we aren‚Äôt anywhere near mass adoption yet. Once adoption is on a large scale, volatility goes way down. It is in fact being used in third-world countries right now (el Salvador, Venezuela) as currency because their own currencies are that bad, and BTC is actually the better option. 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin A stable coin stays stable. The long term average ROI for Bitcoin is about 100% per year.

Someday you will be old, and you won't want to work any more.  You'll want to golf, go sailing, travel...  Most people can't do that; most people end up broke by the time they reach retirement age.  People who buy and hold Bitcoins, long term get to go to Maui to play golf when they get old.  

But not you.  No.  You were so fucking smart, that you figured out that Bitcoin wasn't a good money substitute, at least in your mind.  Enjoy your trailer park retirement. Your life is over a longer period than a few days. Bitcoin is the best performing asset in all of human history. Once the bitcoin price is way above your cost basis do you care about volitilty? 

What you really want to buy is your time back. Everyone who has held bitcoin for a couple of cycles are now retired and living their best life. A decentralized stable crypto will only work when all central banks of the world come together and work with the world bank to create a one world crypto currency not controlled by one countries government. Until then stable coins pegged to the $USD is what third world countries should use if they want to use a stable crypto."

Whether you like it or not, politicians **are** going to be more involved as Bitcoin continues its rise to relevance, they are not just going to relinquish the power of the money printer without a fight but they also see that the free market wants this, the free market wants Bitcoin to become ~~a currency~~ legal tender.

Leave all the other bullshit at the door, this is about opening your mind to Bitcoins role as the base layer of a new financial system. Has anyone ever told him he looks like Enrique Iglesias? Speaker list is looking stacked:

https://b.tc/conference/speakers

Some dubious people included, but it's gonna lead to a lot of interesting talks and presentations. Voted for him in 08 Ron Paul has been an advocate for freedom longer than most of y'all have been alive.  A man of uncommon integrity and principle, a true lion of liberty.  No other politician has ever been worthy of my vote. Well this thread went to shit real fast.

Regardless of your thoughts on RP he can speak to the macro thesis of bitcoin. And I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs going to be there. Ron Paul -- spreading the extremist ideas of individual liberty, peace, free markets, budgeting, and decentralized money. Glad to see he's still in the fight at his age. He is a luminary and truly principled man. People who disagree are generally ignorant of what he's actually done, what he advocates writ large, and what freedom actually means. In other words, they're generally idiots who want others to form their opinions for them. 

RP 2008!! Excellent - he's a great choice to talk about the Fed, fractional reserve banking, and how badly we need to rest power over the currency from the hands of government and their (metaphorical) printing presses.

Other folks here have heard that their friends don't like Ron Paul and that he's a republican, so they're knee-jerking really hard - his views on gun rights or abortion are irrelevant to the topic of the conference.  I've seen him speak - he'll be excellent in this capacity.

The speech he gave that I saw (and he signed a book for me afterwards) was unrelated to financial systems - it was about how personal liberty was effectively divvied up between the two major American parties in the mid-20th century, and has fed the ongoing partisanship and political football game ever since.  That really doesn't fit the narrative that the detractors here are trying to push. Wow lots of RP hate. If it wasn‚Äôt for him I wouldn‚Äôt have learned about ending the fed, which leads to bitcoin. I‚Äôm so excited to be going to this conference I met Ron Paul and seen him speak live twice. Ron Paul is the man! Wish I could attend the conference. Ron Paul is a boss patriot genius. Most Reddit users wilt when they hear his name. Ron Paul is the fucking man.

This man has been fighting the Fed harder and longer than anybody. I voted for paul in 2012. It‚Äôs honestly amazing it took someone like me so long to believe in bitcoin. My hero Ron Paul, a real present day founding father If someone like Ron Paul, who was essentially snuffed out of the 2012 Presidential Election, is in support of bitcoin, then you know the mainstream forces are aware of it and fearful of it. He is gentlemen The fact that it‚Äôs not called BitCon makes me angry This is good for the Bitcoins. Please don't make bitcoin a ""right wing"" thing, I don't want to be associated with those clowns How could you invest in bitcoin and not like Ron Paul? Man is a genius and never sold out like Bernie did The best person to ever serve in the US Congress weird, why does politics play in to how you feel about someone speaking on behalf of btc! everyone here is creating fud, confrence will be great, leave your politics at the door w/ the fud. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ the best president we never had üòé
Love Ron Paul How many people here are reacting the way they are because they're confusing Ron Paul with his incompetent, human garbage son, Rand Paul? Oh brother... don't need this GQP masquerading as a libertarian talk anything about BTC. Ron Paul is based AF. This event will be on all news channels. I wonder how that will affect the price of BTC...  
Looks like meat is back on the menu, boys! Time to stack those sats. 
I think Bitcoin is a gamble but Ron Paul in the same context speaking on related topics is very interesting.

The longer things go on the more correct he seems to be but the music hasn't stopped so he's a mainstream pariah in his own time. Awesome. I really need to go now All the soyboys & NPC's are going to be inflamed and will try to rip apart the bitcoin community just because one guy they disagree with will be at this conference. Ew. 

I saw his Wolf Blitzer question on a hypothetical 30 yr old man not paying corporate healthcare prices, which btw is fucking insane in this country, should be left to die.

His libertarian freedom is a ""freedom to starve"" argument. Dont like his son either. Not to mention he lectured at that wackjob shindig Anarcapulco, the one where John Galton was murdered by the Cartels in the most AnCap ""in practice"" story I ever read.

 As an Anarchist more in line with 1893s Peter Kropotkin and The Conquest of Bread, Ron Paul Ancaps arent really anarchists, they have a toilet ideology, they recognize all other anarchists as a threat to their invocation of ""anarchism"". Anyone who hates on Ron Paul hated on crypto back when it was an emergent technology and is just here because they think they can make money on a speculative bubble IT'S HAPPENING

On a side note, fuck you to whomever disses Ron Paul. The man is a Saint compared to the trash that's been running this country for decades and still presently occupies the WH. Ron Paul is OG Austrian Economics crossover with Rothbard Fuck Ron Paul, and his son. Ron Paul posed as libertarian but voted with the GOP most of the time. His son is a complete moron who won‚Äôt even get vaccinated. I just don‚Äôt understand the big tent theory when you‚Äôre pulling in divisive old people that will only stir up political griefers and add chaos to the community. Fuck Ron Paul...I don‚Äôt give a shit about his Bitcoin position....fuck this old man! Big if true Great, more lunatics to keep us form going mainstream. [removed] This might be the guy Dan Bailey was keeping a secret for the longest time as the surprise secret guest. Maybe there‚Äôs something real big going on, and this is going to be good for Bitcoin. Dude Ron Paul!

Will the conference be streamed for free? This is bullish Ron Paul & Elon Musk..... BTC is doomed. Sell all of it  before 1 BTC = 300$ [removed] :-/ Ugh! THAT is one presentation I would not attend.  One step above the village idiot. [removed] [removed] Oh you Americans. This is what mass adoption looks like, or the start of it, I assure you mass adoption was not going to start with BTC and puppies for all. You people are ridiculous. I don‚Äôt give a shit about politicians!! I‚Äôm all about making $$$$$ money and don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs Republican or Democrat that can help me get it. Yea yea yea on the next episode of the waiting on my Lambo Bullish I guess Gwyneth Paltrow was booked They should rename it to ""Magic Beans 2021"" Watch him for another stroke.  That was freaky seeing him scramble on live tv BTC is like the Nissan Leaf and now we have Tesla yet people still talking about how great the leaf was. Also what good is a currency that you don‚Äôt spend? Hedge against inflation for who? Those that already have money cause most of us want to use money and BTC is too slow to use for everyday transactions. I hold BTC but as long as BTC remains the topic Satoshi‚Äôs vision of a currency remains unachieved. Ron Paul is 85 years old, surely his experience will be relevant to bitcoin."

It‚Äôs exhilarating I love the notion behind it and I wish I found this years and years ago as I‚Äôm sure some of you wish too. I had no passions before this and was extremely depressed and suicidal and man has this helped me immensely. Simply waiting for a check to click buy while I crack open a beer is like a rush to me. I‚Äôm a super nerd I guess cause the lingo and tech and podcasts are just consumed in my everyday reads and I couldn‚Äôt ask for anything better. This being said, when BTC skyrockets what are some thoughts or maybe some tips? Do I sell all of my allocation at a new ATH to buy back in on a dip to acquire cheaper sats for more of my buck. Do I Hodl infinitely? We‚Äôre not at the point just yet where we can borrow against it completely from what I understand. So what do I do? Of course I want a profit but I mean come on, what else is better than owning the most stable monetary asset in the history of civilization. Maybe a Bat cave with a bat mobile, but hey I‚Äôm still stacking! Thankyou for reading this :) hodl and laugh at the fud !;9;"Buy the dip Except for one year, every crash has been bottomed out higher than the year before ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure there are smart people that can work out the swings and shit but it‚Äôs too much work for me 

I plan to just HODL until I can borrow against my holding If you make it to 24/25.. you don't have to think about money ever again. Regular therapy sessions. Sudden massive increase of wealth changes the human psyche and you as a person unless you keep tabs on it and actively work to keep your post-wealth mindset. 

I‚Äôd never sell my whole stack, but I‚Äôd certainly use it to make some dreams come true. That said I will never be in a position where I can afford enough btc for it to turn into life changing wealth (currently a broke student), so for me it‚Äôs a moot point. I‚Äôll likely use mine to help with a down payment for a forever home somewhere nice eventually. Fer Shure! Hodl hodl hodl Just hodl forever and buy the dips.

One day you will be a paper millionaire, but remember, you cannot sell, just hodl Hodl and stack more sats. Good HODLing attitude increases your chances of striking gold with your investments.

It is also best to diversify your portfolio with coins which has a huge potential value. Reallocate some of your funds in projects with good fundamentals.

Bitcoin was released in 2009. In 1984, TCP/IP were the same age that the bitcoin protocol is right now.

Bitcoin is hard money. It's finite. You can store it securely. You can transfer it to anyone without third parties. If bitcoin didn‚Äôt exist less common folk would understand what fiat means, the corruption of the central banks and Wall Street bailouts being tied to said fiat system, endless war financed by fiat, and the Cantillon effect to name a few. 

Governments would not be deploying a CBDC so quickly either, a reflection of how they view bitcoin as a threat to their totality. The US government could have stopped bitcoin in its infancy but it is too late now.

Bitcoin is like a Rorschach test put in front of the bankers, only in this test the banks don‚Äôt see what they want to see(endless printing benefiting the oligarchs) they see a potential store of value they can‚Äôt control. Is that not worth at least 1 million dollars in fiat funny money?

edit: for clarity There is Bitcoin, and then there are alt-coins, which are also known as shitcoins because most of them are outright scams.  

https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin-only/

Bitcoin is not a scam.  Please don't lump Bitcoin with shitcoins. In terms of tech it‚Äôs not new by those standards. In terms of currency or a potential new store of value, there is nothing like it as it‚Äôs a complexity new asset class - monetary value stored as energy. In that sense it‚Äôs relatively new and is still proving itself. You jump very quickly to assuming the answer to ""what would happen if blockchain disappeared tomorrow"" would be ""very little""

My guess is that someone other than satoshi would carry on the work on decentralized cryptographic networks that was already in existence and that laid the foundation for bitcoin. New technology does not happen in a vacuum

In fact historically it is not uncommon for new technologies to be discovered and developed simultaneously. Calculus and atomic weaponry are the first examples off the top of my head but there are countless others. What would happen if Newton did not invent calculus? Leibnitz would have got the credit. 

tldr: if blockchain disappeared tomorrow someone would invent it."

As if I'm gonna give Polis any of my corn.

Yyeh nnah. Wow. That‚Äôs actually pretty big. Uhh doesn't Ohio already do this Ohio was the first state to accept bitcoin for taxes Don't get me started on Colorado and state taxes.

Ever since the Wayfair Supreme Court ruling, businesses have had to collect sales tax for sales in any state in which they do more than a minimal amount of business (even if the business has no actual presence in the state -- just shipping orders to customers in that state).

Of all the states I've dealt with, Colorado has, by far, the most annoyingly elaborate sales tax filing system; you need to file a separate form each month for every sales tax district in the state.  The entire monthly filing for Colorado is easily hundreds of pages.  (This isn't for a big business; we're collecting and forwarding to Colorado just $10 or $20 in sales tax every month.  The amount of money involved isn't burdensome; it's the sheer time required to prepare the forms every month that's just ridiculous.)

And Colorado's online sales tax payment website doesn't save  your work automatically, so if you get interrupted unexpectedly, you have to start over again from scratch. this is VERY bad... you think the state is just going to HODL? or you think they are going to dump every single coin onto an exchange the second they get them in fear that they would lose money - and youre going to pay MORE tax on that crypto if you use it to pay taxes.. its an incentive to get people to actualize gains and double dip

and what if there is a crash like this month? a government with paper hands ready to drop millions of dollars at a whim out of fear of losing profit

institutions and governments arent your friend No way am I giving up my crypto to the government Thats a horrible idea Literally the reason to we believe in Crypto is to avoid shit like this JarJar Polis seems to be a cool dude, glad he's my gov. I case you're thinking about moving elsewhere cause your jurisdiction is fucked... Jared Polis is a good guy and has been a supporter of Bitcoin since 2014 The worst thing about paying taxes on crypto, is to get taxed twice when you have to sell crypto to pay the bill... Let‚Äôs go....... I think Ohio accepted Bitcoin in 2018 for taxes.  Oh yeah they did, but now it‚Äôs suspended. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/thenextweb.com/news/ohio-suspends-bitcoin-tax-payment-system-no-one-cares-ohiocrypto/amp Hell yeah to the adoption! But I would rather pay my taxes in diminishing fiat currency and keep my crypto. Wait we don't want the government to have our Bitcoin? It'll be 3rd or 4th at this point Lock my paid crypto & only unlock it for the govt use that I approve. I thought az already allows it? Hypothetically, how would paying taxes with crypto work ? Would the tax payer transfer to the government's wallet ? Would the government have to be mindful of the USD to Crypto conversion volatility ? I always wondered who the hell buys these metal coins. Hmm just saying you can already pay taxes in cryptocurrency. 

Arizona is case and point. 

But also don‚Äôt do this. Do you really want to be taxed twice? I thought Wyoming already excepted Bitcoin Didn't Ohio accept Bitcoin already? IRS Scammers are going to take so much advantage of this. The way CO has completely mismanaged COVID and created and exasperated the already bad homeless situation in Denver and Boulder I really hope NO ONE is stupid enough to pay them in BTC regardless of the supposed 'legitimization' claims that may come from this. Seriously, the shutdown and unemployment situation there caused untold amounts of misery, someone tried to steal the catalytic convertor on my car when I was on Pearl Street Mall and I caught them in the process as they were jacking up my car in the snow. 

After I deescalated the situation I asked them why they were doing that and he said it was because thier unemployment money hadn't been paid since December (this as in April during the snow storms) due to a a horribel software contractor that cost millions and he and his family hadn't eaten in a week. I ended up giving them the last $17 I had on me but seriously Colorado managed to fuck up all the progress they made since 2012 with MJ legalization and the massive population and housing tax revenue. 

It goes to show that even a small(er) population is not immune to the inherit stupidity of governments due to the largess a certain class of people always benefit from.

They can all go fuck themselves, and I hope they never see a single satoshi; all they managed to do was create a massive police state and ever growing militarized police state in certain towns with some favourable decriminalization regarding cannabis and psychedelics with the immense amount of tax funds, but other than that most things got worse. 

I prefer the Colorado of 2007 when I first visited and only a fraction of the population. They have much bigger problems ahead of them that I KNOW they cannot solve, they created sweetheart deals for housing developers to purge water from farms to them and so despite all the glut of housing the bubble has made it such that you have large homelessness and sky-high.housing prices which are all net benefits from a certain class of people propping up the prices and excess money printing at the Fed, who all donate to their elections so it won't stop anytime soon. 

Colorado made sense when it had 1/2 the population or less, so I hope they end up losing more people who decide to leave in the next decade or two so we can go back to somewhat normal housing and living standards, which required lower taxes in general to fund. Nope, Kanton Zug, Switzerland dies it allready. I would never pay the gov in crypto. They can have their stupid, devaluing fiat. They made their bed, now they can sleep in it. Nooooo! If the govt starts getting involved they will start trying to regulate the sh*t out of it and  Reminder of the DMV that requires you to get permission to use your own property. Keep govt out of Bitcoin."
465;Yesterday I was pleased to host a meeting between @elonmusk & the leading Bitcoin miners in North America. The miners have agreed to form the Bitcoin Mining Council to promote energy usage transparency & accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide.;nk6vjg;6191;1621886491.0;Shutae;;222;"Edit: [Issue #998: This is the opposite of owning the framing by Marty Bent is also a good read on this issue
](https://tftc.io/martys-bent/issue-998/)

This is some weird subversive collusion reminiscent of [the blocksize war \(everyone should read it\)](https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM). more to come.


Dear /r/Bitcoin 

Allow me to use my exorbitant privilege of green stickied comments to make the following rant. This is my personnel opinion only.

To Elon Musk. Fuck You.

To Michael Saylor, Fuck You Too.

To the Miners Who collude to censor Bitcoin transactions, Have a big, FUCK YOU.

To the idiot miners who go along with the ESG agenda, I encourage you to reconsider.

With some of that rage out of the way, lets get down to the concerns & implications of recent fuckery in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Setting the scene:

So we got Saylor, he comes in like a bull in a china shop and we freakin love him for it. Gets all that clout and a mass following by plebs who don't know any better about cults of personality in the Bitcoin space (they all get sacrificed in the end). 

Most Ego's in this space get greedy and lose the signal to pump different bullshit. Which is usually fine when they move on to their different projects and leave Bitcoin alone.

But this time, it feels like they are gunning for something at a Bitcoin protocol level, and I'm pissed about it so I'll try my best here to call them out on what I feel is going on.

Then we got elon, that poor tragic soul. He doesn't last long and has started spreading general misinformation these past few weeks on such a subversive level that you wonder if he's trolling or compromised.

Next, marathon patent group and DMG. These fuckers get the bright idea to only include ""OFAC approved"" transactions inside the Bitcoin Blocks they mine. great, you're allowed to do that! Even if it means you lose mining revenue for doing so, and even if it means you still include OFAC violating transactions in your blocks. Hey, at least it's a good headline and gets the regulators hard. fucking idiots.

For any mining pools or operators who are considering this slippery slope, know that it's a bad idea for you and your operation long term. You will not have community support for virtue signaling or appealing to unenforceable regulatory burden, or by lobbying to impose your bullshit standard on other miners. 

Once we start with ""OFAC approved"" blocks, it never ends. You give an inch, you give a mile. This is just the start to a slippery slope of censored Bitcoin transactions.



**So with those three elements (Saylor, Elon, Marathon) and a few other Bitcoin miners all in one room behind closed doors, they decide to form** 

[**A cartel.**](https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1396915803082080256) 



...maybe this was inevitable. But to you few who see what I see and feel what I feel, rage against the dark for you only burn once in this life. 

To [Hut8 Mining](https://twitter.com/Hut8Mining), [Argo Blockchain](https://twitter.com/ArgoBlockchain), [Riot Blockchain](https://twitter.com/RiotBlockchain), [Marathon Digital Holdings](https://twitter.com/MarathonDH), [Hive Blockchain](https://twitter.com/HiveBlockchain), [Galaxy Digital](https://twitter.com/GalaxyDigitalHQ), [Core Scientific](https://twitter.com/Core_Scientific), [BLOCKCAP](https://twitter.com/blockcap), I ask, are you a part of a intelligence agency run mining cartel?

It's a rhetorical question as you can't know the answer to this question. You should be operating under the assumption that such things are possible and proceed accordingly. cautiously. ie, not at all.

For you independent miners who use any of these pools and can switch, do so now, ideally to https://braiins.com/stratum-v2

To you fucks who are fucking around, 

[We see you](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106939193085952). Affiliating Musk with BTC is playing with fire and a very bad idea IMHO. It should be about the coin, not the person! What the fuck does Elon Musk have to do with a Bitcoin mining council? ü§î 

Billionaires hold a private meeting to form a BTC Mining Council? without any form of consensus? (except their own) to promote their idea of ‚Äòenergy transparency‚Äô on a borderless, decentralised digital currency?

Fuck me, may as well of held the meeting on Jakyll Island.

No doubt Saylor showed Musk where he intends to get the BTC tattoos on his thighs. Only days after Elon‚Äòs [Saylor Moon](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1393983247311380482)... There are already miners pursuing mining with clean energy (in NA), Saylor and Musk are not required to dictate the future of bitcoin Fuck both of them. They don't care about you, stop worshipping them. And stop letting them take over. I don't give a fuck what Elon Musk has to say honestly. So sick of this guys 2 cents on every topic. Fucking Elon is trying to become the Bitcoin Jesus Satoshi never wanted to be. 

How can we stop this? Who TF appointed Michael as the saviour of Bitcoin and why do we need to convince Elon or anyone else about  bitcoin energy? Insanity. No sense of history. Please tell Musk he can go fuck himself. Egotistical asshole. I've heard more than enough from him. I don‚Äôt know why everyone so happy about this ? Did you all forget 2017 NY closed door meeting ? Whoa what about decentralized tho That sounds like a... centralization? Think about this for a second.

Why would any self respecting miner who put their own resources to mine bitcoin be part of this coalition? What do they have to gain?. 

bitcoin is decentralized for a good reason. Any effort to centralize it will defeat the purpose. 

It appears, these people are  turning bitcoin ecosystem into a popularity contest. This is all planned I think most people are overreacting, I see this is as positive. This is voluntary, self-disclosure about energy usage in an attempt to make the space more transparent and palatable to potential investors concerned about bitcoins carbon intensity. Miners are doing what they are supposed to, following incentives and acting in their own best interest which is directly tied to the unit price of bitcoin. Clearly, they feel that managing public perception around energy FUD will benefit bitcoin. If miners, of their own volition, decide to disclose a standardized report on their energy consumption they are free to do so, and I don‚Äôt see how this can threaten the security of bitcoin or represents a breach of its core values. Plebs, hodl your own keys, run your own node, and prepare for war Fuck Michael Saylor. Who are these people and why do they matter in a decentralised market. Stop üõë making the rich, richer. Hope we can all learn a lesson from this in a few months time - not allowing these guys to affect the market. Miners anyway are going into green energy so it sounds more like a PR camping to shut down this nonsensical environment fud. It will make musk shut up too. Saylor is smart. Elon is totally buying the dip How centralized! The miners have agreed to form a centralized coalition. Smh Miners will become increasingly reliant on mining fees as the block reward declines.

This will make miners dependent on transaction fees too cost prohibitive to run operations that exclude too many transactions.

Furthermore, there's several ways we as users can fight back.

Such as directly giving even ""approved"" or ""clean"" transactions directly to mining pools which remain agnostic.

It may take a while longer to get confirmed, though you would be able to strangle those discriminatory practices out of existence.

Bitcoin wallets could start to opt into combative strategies like this to direct a wide majority of transaction volume to join the fight 

I do not see this as ultimately necessary though.
If we end up needing it, we will be ready. Since when does DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO need fucking AUTHORITIES ??  Shove your council up your you arrogant rich cunts And we're back Have you ppl lost your mind? Who is the fuck is this guy and Elon to enforce a mining council? Great. Let the billionares create a coalition. FUCKING GREAT FOR THE LITTLE GUY Fuck you Musk. You clown toolbox. You are the worst thing that happend to crypto. Stop giving Elon so much power. Its ridiculous by now. He is not the crypto king.üò° Having a council decide on the future path of any crypto takes away from the ""decentralization"" aspect thereof.

Would be nice if the counsel would rather host ideas and questions and have us, the people vote on the path forward. Elon proving himself to be one of the biggest kooks in existence So - we are all just gunna agree that miners shouldn‚Äôt tell the world that they are mining green... ‚ÄúBig daddy Musk... do you approve??‚Äù

Fuck those guy and what they think. Everyone needs to stop stroking these billionaires‚Äô  egos by acting like we need their permission to exist.

Also, most of your posts are praising Michael Saylors. Are you sure this isn‚Äôt secretly his account? Elon Musk acting like he is Satoshi, and Bitcoin is his invention. Why do people listen to him?! Ok, let me get this straight...

Murrica with their constant banter against China, constantly producing FUD about Chinese miners being controlled by the state and trying to take over, censor or attack Bitcoin (of which there is not the slightest actual sign). Some of those Murricans are now trying to form a cartel of miners, of which some if I understand that correctly push for censoring transactions?

Not sure how we got there, but now I hope China doesn't crack down on their miners... Could we stop giving a voice to Elon musk. He is nothing. He has nothing to do with bitcoin, he has nothing to do with crypto, he is just greedy entrepenuer who can do anything to survive and stay relevant. 
He had jumped eveey fucking popular trend or event ,even the disasters, to make it about himself. He doesnt care about bitcoins vision and he will not when we we need someone. There needs to be a way to obfuscate the sender and receiver of a  transaction to ensure that censorship is impossible at the protocol level. Optional privacy is not real privacy. Soooooooo... centralization? I find it fascinating that Blockstream Mining wasn't in the room.

Wonder what we know that they don't? Holy fuck, people. Just pass some kind of halfway reasonable carbon tax and you then have a much more rational way to ensure that bitcoin miners and users have the right incentives regarding the costs they externalize...but so does everybody else including banks, gold miners, cement plants, auto-makers, and grid operators.

Done. 

Everybody stop posturing about the whole mining electricity consumption ""problem"". Stop virtue signalling about it. Stop pretending you have some particularly damning argument against bitcoin because of it (and admit that you're just an irrational permaskeptic authoritarian and that you hate people having a choice in what money they use). Stop pretending like it's a problem unique to bitcoin.  Stop trying to manipulate crypto based on it and for the love of hodl, stop being such weak-minded, paper-handed pussies about what the fuck any stupid rich person or China says about bitcoin.
I declare this no longer an issue and the world is done talking about it because it's fucking stupid and a distraction.

There. I said it. Elon donates solar and Tesla batteries to mining sites.  Mining sites become ‚ÄúGreen.‚Äù  Bitcoin goes up.  Elon make huge profit when Bitcoin go to $300,000..... Now that Elon Musk has been able to accumulate more BTC at a discounted price by orchestrating a large-scale crash, he is once again positive about the future of Bitcoin.

Amazing ...

You simply have to stop giving so much credit to a person who has shown that he is not a Bitcoiner at all. Elon, just fuck off a closed doors meeting hosted by the *elite* to make decisions nobody asked for to better comply with regulations the community shouldn‚Äôt give any fucks about. 

bitcoin is financial freedom, remember that. Elon Musk is a dodgy grifter! I used to love that guy but the more I read into his behaviour, the more I realise that he is a sociopath Musk is now pumping BTC in the lead up to Teslas latest quarterly. Finally the centralization we were all looking for. So about that decentralisation No stopping BTC at this point.

Don't put anyone on a pedestal. Sounds centralized üëéüèª Oh Elon Tusk is starting to turn around a bit right after he bought the dip? Who could've predicted that. So wait, it‚Äòs a win-win-win situation.

1. Bitcoin is on its way to fulfil certain sustainability criteria, i.e. a precursor for investments by large institutions (see possible near-term approval of a BTC ETF; see also today‚Äôs news of Goldman considering BTC as an investable asset). All this is beneficial for the whole crypto space.
2. Big players were able to buy in cheap.
3. Elon Musk (and his followers) will celebrate himself for making Bitcoin mining more eco-friendly. His influence in the crypto space will become even greater.

So who loses? Well, as always: the small fry that was on the brink of losing precious money and panic-sold. can we ban elon from bitcoin? he‚Äôs just a profit hungry narcissistic man child, he tried his best to destroy bitcoin for the last month, he has no place here. Way to assuage the fucking idiots. And now a round of press, thank you! Musk can get fucked, he‚Äôs head of Bitcoin now or something just because he bought a lot of it this year? He just wants to be the man who made Bitcoin green, despite the fact it already mostly is. I hate the fact that people still fall for his cult. 

Saylor can get fucked too. No one made him head of Bitcoin either, just a coke head who turned his shitting failing software business around by buying a lot of Bitcoin less than a year ago. 


Enough with the rich guys trying to hijack Bitcoin please. Stupid idea. But, might accelerate the destruction of non-fungible control exertion. $MARA WANTS TO REGULATE BLOCKS AND ONLY MINE ‚Äú OFAC‚Äù COMPLIANT BLOCKS


THIS IS A THREAT TO BITCOIN 

FIGHT I thought we already had the CCA? Crypto Climate Accord? We don‚Äôt need Elon for anything. His input shouldn‚Äôt be paraded personally I plan to burn forests to power my furnace to get green electricity to power my miner.

Happy now? Stop caring about that attention-seeking asshole ffs Can someone explain all this to me as if they are talking to a 10-year old? Thanks! Seems a little too coordinated to me... Billionaires with delusions of grandeur and miner collude behind closed door to ""make the world a better place"". Fuck them all. What's next? censorship of ""dirty bitcoins"",changing the protocol to be more green? KYC of users? how decentralized of them... Musk sank Bitcoin on purpose a couple of weeks ago and he blamed too much energy  use. Then he or someone he hired bought a shit load of Bitcoin at the reduced price. He is now going to come up with some great technology to save the planet using Bitcoin. They only care bout the mighty dollar. Sounds decentralized to me \s Whatever this is is turning a decentralized network into a centralized cluster of F$ck!!! And who is this Musk guy??? Oh a government's tit sucker!!! We can call this counsel the Federal Reserve Mine. I smell centralization. Why? Disgusting how Saylor is catering to Musk Bitcoin Mining Council? This is not decentralization. We don‚Äôt need billionaires to form groups with each other. #fuckmusk Man, fuck Elon Musk. That dude is ruining shit for everyone. Yeah. This seems like a step in the WRONG direction. This sounds like more centralization again... ‚Äúthey‚Äù are getting they‚Äôre fingers in the crypto system and now they want to control it also... that‚Äôs the problem with ‚Äúthem‚Äù. They must control our society and everything in it. I I don‚Äôt like it at all. ESG is going to get weaponized often as a pretext now for capitalist gains. It happens with almost every initiative Yippee Alternative energy generation is kind of cheap (solar panels, in my case, are dirty cheap), the problem is storage.

Oh, Tesla has overpriced storage batteries? Musk is a real world attempt at manifesting the CEO of Bitcoin meme. Elon is a delusional narcissist I‚Äôm so fucking tired of elon musk Only way to fix this is to get a large correction to 18-19k and hope it gets pressed there for the rest of the year. This should clear them out. fuck elon Who died and put Elon musk in charge of bitcoin. Go make cars and stfu. This is allowed in a completely decentralized market. They can do whatever they want and we can do whatever we want. If they change something we don't like, they can go off on their own chain. It's not the first or the last time. Who gives a single fuck what Musk has to say. Since when this guy is the CEO of Bitcoin ? A billionaire is not our friend.... Fuck Saylor. 
Nothing more to say here. Sounds like centralisation to me. I dont think you realize how bad this is for BTC and crypto in general. There nothing decentralize about this meeting.... So whats the point of it? Might as well move my assets to fiat Please don't feed the Ego. Musk is a toxic narcissist. Fuck Elon Musk! When the fuck did he crown himself the second coming of Satoshi.  I wish they‚Äôd just fuckin arrest him already. Doesn‚Äôt sound very decentralised to me. When I saw Barry Silbert's tweet, I interpreted that as a bad sign for bitcoin and liquidated everything. A good decision. 

This is even worse. Two guys who own a pretty good stack of bitcoin, trying to save their faces. North American miners? Is this a joke?

Worse yet, they are the CEO of a company. Isn't the CEO very busy? Do they have time for this? Oh, I sold Tesla stock as well. Musk getting involved makes me want to stop buying BTC and get started on a different coin‚Ä¶. Maybe if we all stop listening to and feeding Elon he will go away."

467;Is buying crypto gambling?;nm2rls;8;1622103743.0;vaggelis_flks;I am 17 years old and i just started learning about crypto currency and NFT's. I check the market prices once a day just to understand how prices change and varies depending on the coin. Crypto to me is a really interesting topic and I love it so far, but I struggle to believe that it's not similar to a gambling game, maybe it's because I am not experienced enough and I have no Idea how to make money out of it farther than buying and holding until the market explodes. I would appreciate it if you could enlighten me on the topic and give me some useful advices to begin.;29;"Not sure about other people.  
But to me almost everything is some kind of gamble - not in the 'playing a game' sense. Because everything has risk. Risk is usually the foundation of a game - that there is probability to alter the situation for the better in exchange for exposure to risk.  
Going to the store is a gamble, albeit relatively safe.  
You could get run over and die when you invest your time to go there and acquire goods.  
It happens.  
I guess that is why some people say that 'life is a game'.  
I think it is a question how you prefer to perceive it.  
This is why a lot of economics is about maintaining risk. The price is the least interesting part of crypto, but sadly the most important to most of the people online. You just need to do more research, and when you will understand exactly what problems Bitcoin solves, you won't need to be convinced to buy in. Buying shitcoins is gambling, buying coins with solid projects is investing. In layman's terms, imagine being one of the people that pumped thousands of dollars into facebook or amazon when they were just a college hookup site or a bookstore. You'd be rich beyond you're wildest dreams. BTC is still in it's infancy in regards to adoption. It may not make you as rich (as you would need quite a lot of capital and you are only 17), but IF btc is adopted - the upside would be stupidly high. You‚Äôre very young, best to read as much you can about bitcoin and blockchain, watch coursera or other free videos. Then jump in and buy some crypto to get how it works in practice. 

But if you are planning to slowly build an investment, I‚Äôd suggest looking at equities first, before venturing into crypto in a big way. It's a risk not a gamble. Nearly everything you do in life is gambling an outcome is worth the effort or expense to a certain degree.  Preferably you gamble on your understanding of crypto rather than just gambling on crypto.  And the more knowledge you have the more likely you are to win.  Same as most things. Look into RVN probably one of the better and upcoming projects out there atm Hi there!

The difference between gambling and investing is knowledge. 

Look for good sources on the topic and invest accordingly, only to projects you believe in. If you invest because the price goes up, you will sell when the price goes down. And that happens a lot in crypto - even though on average for example Bitcoin goes up a lot!

Might I suggest two information sources to you?

First one is Dan Held's youtube channel. He is a veteran on crypto, and holds top positions on Kraken exchange and Uber. He makes good videos about bitcoin that are easy to understand. 

https://youtube.com/channel/UCsXmJLugF3fwjzc-Qnoi5lQ

The other source is the book ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous. You might find it in a library or purchase the audiobook. If you truly want to learn about crypto, there is no alternative to reading a book. 

I'm taking a wild guess that your future self will thank you for educating yourself on this topic! 

It's also important to understand math, economics, civics and have a general good understanding of the world as everything is really tied together some way or another! ‚úåÔ∏è

Best of luck! The question should be answered on the similar lines of :Trading vs Investment in any stocks,mutual funds etc

If you are going to Invest for a long term there is an element of  risk, but thats just like any other thing you do in life; crossing a road is not considered a gambling though there is a risk in it.

If the end goal is just day/weekly trading then yes its just pure gambling (because I have not seen any strategy or methods which gives 100% results all the time)

Now if just considering the - I am here for making money factor and I don‚Äôt care what what issues a blockchain can solve (which is the majority of us)
There is a higher element of risk in cryptos because its still in its nascent stage and a minimal % of use case scenarios exist today for a crypto. So we are really hoping that Bitcoins be used and approved by most of the organisations and countries. In my opinion at your age start with S&P.  It‚Äôs a slow and steady grind that can teach you many things along the way.   Invest daily, weekly, or monthly.  Learn about what companies you are invested in.   After a few years of that you will have solid foundation of investing.   From there you can try your hand at crypto.   Which is different, it is not companies you are investing in.  Anyone can make up a crypto currency and start selling it.  Investing in crypto is investing into a network of people.   The more people that believe in it the more valuable it becomes.  NFT, I have not looked into it very much.  Nothing I can say about it.  

I‚Äôm glad you are interested in investing at such a young age.   It is something I wish my parents or school taught me.  Good luck! Or I should say Invest Wisely! I think of it as educated gambling If ""buying bitcoin"" is gambling, then consciously making the decision to *not* buy bitcoin is also gambling. Not a financial advisor, the below is not financial advice.

To an extent it *is* a gamble in that you are taking on risk, and despite careful planning, things can nosedive the moment Elon Musk logs onto Twitter. I generally tell people not to invest money they wouldn't be comfortable with taking to a casino. I'd say that with all trading really.

The key difference Vs a casino is that with trading, your odds aren't nearly so hilariously rigged against you - once you understand what you're putting your money into. 

Buying and holding until the market explodes generally IS the way most people here have made money on Bitcoin. But another part of it is choosing when to buy as well; you'd have been boned if you bought in a couple of weeks ago, for example. If you like the idea of crypto and aren't just trying to get rich quick then the price shouldn't matter very much. Just don't invest any money you can't afford to lose and keep educating yourself. Yes. This subreddit will tell you otherwise because its filled with hardcore fans that are sure they will get rich because Bitcoin will take over the world. 

Reality is, nobody knows, nobody can tell anything with any certainty. It can fall to zero or go to the moon. Dont invest money you are not prepared to loose completely. Bruh Yes. Worse in fact, as gambling is generally legislated to have a minimum payout percentage and table games have fair odds. Not that I‚Äôm recommending gambling, this is just bro astrology + gambling + social media addiction You are right. It's a fine line between investment and gambling. Even long term holding send to be just slower gambling. I think buying crypto because of the project and understanding the financial benefits is the key. More long term investment in a bank-free future than strict gambling. Crypto is on the scene permanently. To some extent it certainly is gambling in the sense that it's a volatile market and the value your crypto has today can be halved by tomorrow.

However, it is also very much investing since you put money in promising projects with the expectation that it will be worth more in the future. By keeping up to date with developments of the crypto you're invested in it becomes less of a gamble and more of an investment. Also, by buying the dip it's less of a gamble that you will make a profit compared to buying at all time high. 

However, never forget that it's a volatile market and a relatively new technology in which there are a lot of uncertainties. There are no guarantees. That's why you should only invest what you are able to lose (or hodl for a long time). You have the luxury of choosing an entry point it would be wise to get into it on a dip anywhere around 30k. That would be mirroring recent whale moves and it marks a bottom in the market so far. Is buying a knife murdering?  - it depends on what made you decide to buy and what you are going to do once you have it. The USD is a gamble
Lol Thank goodness you ended up in bitcoin and not a shitcoin. There are a few good other cryptos out there too (notice i said FEW). There are thousands of crypto and most of them are straight pump and dumps. Its pure gambling going with any shitcoin. Bitcoin is digital gold and is a good store of value.

Most crypto follows the price of bitcoin to a degree. The end goal is to get more bitcoin. Buying ""crypto"" is pretty much gambling. Some coins are a lot riskier than others. Even buying bitcoin could be considered gambling, if you're just trying to make a quick buck.

But consider this: Nobody that bought and held bitcoin for 4 years has lost money. That does not sound like gambling to me. Learn how fiat really works and then you will get Bitcoin Yes. It‚Äôs kind of a fine dance between gambling and not. Depends on if you‚Äôre after long term or short term gains. But as others have said shitcoins fall firmly into the ‚Äògamble‚Äô bracket whereas solid projects are..well..pretty solid. Shitcoins might make you a quick buck if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after but by hell don‚Äôt be the last one holding your bag."

Buying companies of others, claiming them for his own with good marketing and media selling him to the sheeple, then pretending to be the founder and saviour. Bitcoin, btw, is the only path other than hydrogen electrolysis that leads towards 100% renewable energy.  Hydrogen electrolysis needs infrastructure (pipelines, bidirectional hydrogen consumer/business netowrks) to serve as a renewable surplus dump for cheap energy.  If that infrastructure is ready 2 or 4 or 6 years from now, bitcoin mining solution implemented today, can be replaced then with electrolyzers when infrastructure is ready.

For sure, Miner association will look to greenify energy rather than stop mining.  100% renewable energy dependence requires massive renewable surpluses on most days so that there is enough every day.

Larger home solar and larger powerwalls is a perfectly valid solution when paired with bitcoin mining.  Generating surplus power costs as little as 2c/kwh even in retail oversizing. So does pairing batteries and mining with large utility scale solar/wind to deliver 24 hour power always, and steady bitcoin mining most of the time. Oh God.
what nonsense.

All it will do is force miners to start segregating coins and bifurcating coins and potentially diverting secondary mining for things like heat double usage in buildings to more directly identifyable ""green sources.

Its all BS. Elon...go away. you dont know anything about bitcoin. Fuck this guy. He is the new John McAfee Bitcoiners suddenly start to like Elon. Welcome to club guys.

469;Prevent Shorting Bitcoin - Withdraw from 3rd-Party Custody / avoid earning APY;nkvemb;98;1621964230.0;nfosec-pro;"""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"" That's how I'm feeling about the fuckery going on right now with Bitcoin price manipulation, and I no longer want to contribute to it... I'm withdrawing all of my crypto from 3rd-party custody services like Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager back to my hardware wallets so that it is no longer available to be loaned out for use in shorting Bitcoin & suppressing Bitcoin's true value from being revealed to the market. Maybe I'm naive, but I'm hoping to exacerbate the supply shock, increase the price pressure back upwards, and deny gains at my expense.

""All I wanna know is... who's coming with me??!""";21;"If the price of bitcoin goes down due to shorting, you *know* that means you can buy more sats with the same amount of paycheck money in present day, right?

I think worrying about ""bitcoin being shorted"" *might* be overly focused on tomorrow's ""if I sold it all right now"" prices, instead of thinking about what it'll be like 5+ years down the line if prices stay low for the next 4 years and you keep steadily accumulating. Derivatives allow price discovery. If you‚Äôre a young adult, celebrate the discounted prices. But they pay me 1.5% not engaging in the space doesn't make it go away.

This is what you wanted, whether you realized it or not.  The game didn't end, there was no bail out, we are still here.  This is the raw freedom of the market.  Creative destruction at it's finest.

In 10 years, I will have twice my investment while doing what ever the fuck I want with my money.

The systems you despise are the same ones you will require in the future to live off your bitcoin. I hope they short it down to 4 figures, I'd take out a second mortgage and stack HAM.

There are reasons not to use these custodial services, but this isn't the one. The thing is, this is a) useless and b) counterproductive in the long run. Why? Because a) you can short bitcoin via derivatives that actually also impact the price and b) compounding bitcoin via 3rd party providers means they need to pay you back more bitcoin as time passes on. So what you essentially do is create buying pressure while you simple hold your position. That's why in-kind payouts (you provide bitcoin and receive bitcoin) can and will not work in the long run. Who cares what the price does anyway? 1 sat == 1 sat. Better have access to your keys than have a few % interest more than you already have with Bitcoin anyway. 

I am also keeping away from day trading, shorting, using margin or leverage. 

Just buy and hold , it's nice to know that you could become your own bank at some point. Agree fuck the derivatives markets just HODL We're a drop in the ocean. Count me in! Why should I care if they short it? I'm not selling regardless. This is the way .. just have bitcoin in your wallet.. Agreed, I withdrawled all my btc to my cold storage wallet, fuck that apr, if they want they can just take peoples crypto an any moment but we aren‚Äôt gonna take it! Beat you to it. [deleted] This is the way. I'm glad these services exist, but I personally still think self custody is the best way to hodl btc. The best thing about BTC though is you always have the choice! Your 50 milions in BTC are not making any changes to the market those are just second trades , and i am not defending DEFI or APY or whatever . The CEO of Celsius has stated many times in AMA's that they do not loan out coins to institutions looking to short.  He says this would be against the interests of the community and it is considerably riskier than their bread and butter which is loaning to arbitrage institutions and liquidity pools. Already there my friend. Your coin should be yours alone to use (or hodl). Lmao ""bitcoins true value"" ... You're on drugs. The value of anything is whatever people are willing to pay, not some personal opinion.

If you want a crypto savings account alternative then buy a stable coin and stake it.

I've only been in crypto for 2 months now but these types of articles and all the ponzi scheme like youtube charlatans are going to turn new people like myself away from crypto. I agree. I usually say it is a highly volitility CD. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs always been for me I like to think of it as a minimum 5 years fixed savings account away from the banks. Lost 8 grand overnight. CHump change for many but Not me. ... but an annualized growth rate of -470% over the last 5 weeks. See now I think saying stuff like this is dangerous and irresponsible.

That is like only 20% average growth. Hmm. 

No doubt people are disappointed. Hahaha delusional retards Ok, this is really fucking dumb. I love Bitcoin, I own a lot. BUT, it's terrible as a savings account. A savings account should be used for storing cash, either for short-term or as an emergency fund. Bitcoin can have massive swings short-term. It's not good for that yet. The SMP500 10 year average return is 13.6% The idea is to invest for the long term, don't worry about the short term ups and downs, just keep adding to your portfolio and you'll get closer and closer to that 13.6% average.

Bitcoin is the best savings technology in the world.

Buying Bitcoin is not investing, but saving the fruits of your labor to protect them from the ravages of monetary inflation. Bitcoin. Rewarding hodlers since 2008.... HANDSOMELY! People should look at charts. Bitcoin spent 6 out of the past 10 years going nowhere. I have a savings account at my credit union. They pay me 1.1% interest.

478;Where was the Bitcoin mined?;nlnzm0;0;1622053889.0;RealFinancialSuccess;Is there a way to actually track what country the bitcoin was mined? For example, say I'm mining on Antpool (a china pool) and my ASIC finds the hash and I'm in the USA, does that count as if China found the coin or USA? Also, lets say i'm using solar or wind to run my ASIC. I ask because Kevin O'Leary has put out this whole 'Green Coin' thing.;6;"Fuck Mr. Fathead. There are no coins or tokens on the protocol level. Unlike physical coins or dollar bills in your pocket, on bitcoin there are only transactions or UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Output). What this means is that there are only transactions with certain denominations being sent on the network, and addresses show the balance associated with that address, and the history of (transactions from/to) that address.  

If we want to make an analogy to the physical world, it's like taking a coin, melting it down to a liquid form, and minting a new coin again. Some forms of transactions have multiple of such coins as input, and multiple of such coins as outputs (batched transactions, coinjoin transactions).  

The output might the same value as the input, but it's not the same ""coin"" anymore.  

So it's kinda silly to try to find out where your ""coins"" have been mined because there are no coins existing in the first place. Or if you want to argue that there are, then it's like they are being melted down and re-minted with every new transaction involving those coins. Ignore the FUD

everything is made in China and now they decide to pick on poor old Bitcoin that it is mined in China

Even the miners are made in China so if they take a miner, made in China, and mine with the greenest energy on earth, it is still dirty. Chinese energy was used to create the miner in the first place.

With satellite 5g basically a reality now, and smart devices going for pennies, there's no deep dark jungle where the natives won't be using BTC in some form.

It's going to put huge volume into BTC, because the way those work is using the arbitrage to fund their networks, meaning zero transaction fees. noice, nigeria the global juggernaut. at last! This is very good news!

They voted to favour their own not other citizens of the country. They place a ban on crypto trading over 5 or 4 months now. They forgot to know that this trading help most of the youth that‚Äôs jobless in the country. Is my country and we have so many jobless graduates that are very hopeless. Very bad system of Government Lol. Allowed? 

&#x200B;

wtf... Anyone can trade bitcoin. no need for your permission I am a nigerian price, my funds are frozen, please send me bitcoin so i can unlock them. Will pay you back 10000% interest God Bless Nigeria. 

Great national soccer team too. I hereby allow all of Planet Earth to buy, sell and own crypto currency  
y'all can thank me later!  
  
-Random African dictator from a country you never heard of Africa will lead the new world. They are the example of what happens when I centralize financial powers in the west. They are smart to do this That's good because they can't stop it anyways. Oh thank you for your permission‚Ä¶.. pffftt This is good, so Angela can send money to Michael in Lagos in the form of Bitcoin and avoid costly fees from traditional payment services. ""allowed"" LUL...bitcoin doesn't care if it is allowed or not!!! What a lame psyop by the Nigerian gov. inb4 ""Nigeria bans bitcoin"" fud on 2022 [removed] Then they will ban later, then unban, then ban again. Doesnt matter what governments will do. Matters what people will. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. First of all I am black. With that said I do not think we want the Nigerians in on this. They will skin scam the stripes of of a tiger. They will make nonfungible's fungible. these guys have created some of the biggest and most successful scams in the 21st-century. Between them in the Russians. Excuse the mistakes this was a voice text The Nigerian Prices about to become richer and then donate more to us via generous email schemes. Why not create one? The N coin. This will make it easier to send money to my new business partner over there. He's a prince btw. yall are really not funny with the repetitive jokes My uncle has 100 BTC he left to me, but i will need 1 BTC to get back in the wallet.   I am almost there, but if you help me with .2 BTC to get my funds, I will give you 5 back when I have access to the wallet. All those princes need to make a living after all Nigerian princes rejoice! Good support for the Nigerian scammers Boom If the coins are purchased in a private method (p2p, masked IP, no KYC and cold storage), BTC remains outlaw by design. I mean, in this case there would not such way to confiscate it, is that correct? Those Nigerian royalty scams gonna be next level now So I should be getting emails from a Nigerian prince wanting to transfer their Bitcoin inheritance any time now! This is great news!  I‚Äôm a prince in Nigeria but I don‚Äôt have anywhere to put my money. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have a wallet. If you send me your seed phrase, I will deposit 1 million US dollar into your wallet. Once the money is in your wallet, I will tell you which projects I want you to invest 75% of my deposit in. The other 25% is yours to keep!  Just load my new assets onto a hard token and mail it by secure mail to me. I‚Äôll have the assets I want and you‚Äôll ha e 250,000 to invest in whatever you want! 

This is not a scam. Soon we'll be getting emails like ""I am the son of the late general Matwetwe, he passed away from complications after shooting himself in yhe foot, but you are the sole benefactor of his BTC 7 80000 estate ....     ""   #nigerianscammersswitchtocrypto Pretty soon Nigerian princes will be calling asking for your wallet password so they can give you millions in Bitcoin. Nice. Now the prince can send BTC to my wallet once the coup is over. Welp, I know a certain prince who is about to contact me about some crypto. Will the Nigerian princes now start spamming people for crypto currency or stay with fiat? /s

Too soon? Now we can help the Nigerian Prince by giving him some crypto. Finally, that Nigerian Prince can now send me the money he promised in our last email exchange. Oh shit Nigerians Princes will be working overtime to scam idiots out of their coins now I can now transfer funds to the Nigerian prince in btc. Great!

That is great....but till now why they were not allowed? wow Hahaha what a fucking mess that will be. Good for us but dam. That wording this should make the price moon ü§° And he will be accidented soon! The current monetary system won't allow it, or will it Another country trying to ban/allow bitcoin shows they don‚Äôt understand bitcoin When was it not corrupt As if permission had been requested. bro way way too late No one cares what the central bank does in Nigeria. Yeah because the CBoN really had a choice. Finally something smart We should place bets on what the headlines will be for countries that first announce a ‚Äúban‚Äù....it‚Äôs the same outcome every single time lol. Oh, Boy. Now the bad guys are going to be
coming out of the woodwork. The only downside I can see is the one where the maffia without regulation, with an instant can trade their goods.

Put aside dollar and all the corruption goin on there. When we talked about ‚Äútrillions of dollars pouring into Bitcoin‚Äù this isn‚Äôt what we meant. Mint. Nigeria was one of the largest contributors before the ban. ""be allowed"" as language creates FUD that it never was. Just because the government accepts it doesn't mean others don't accept and value it. And finally they get the incentive of doing this Nala!! He's setting the market up for them to ban it and drop the market. Then they will unban it again. 

Rinse and Repeat. Idk if this is good for the cause or not üòÇ Nigeria Coming online lol.  They gonna be the new Monaco Great, now YouTube will be full of Nigerian crypto technical analysts. Well, thank god for THAT !!!

Now nigerians aRe aLloWeD

So ghey You could trade amongst people who had crypto but that was it. No withdrawals or deposits. There was no way to get your money onto an exchange. 419eater is gonna have more work in that avenue. Hope they get more glorious trophy room pics from that front too. Thei no da wae Nigeria doesn't have the best reputation. Sort of like swamp land in Florida, and wire fraud in Nigeria. They might not have invented fraud, but they have made it a big part of their economy. Nigerian prince now powered by crypto I am a Nigerian Prince & I approve this message. (now can you help me?)

487;If the US goes into a recession what kind of response would we likely see with Bitcoin? New to crypto;nl6cai;19;1621996466.0;Kaigo8965;;28;"Dunno mate. I‚Äôm an Aussie - we just ride around the desert on Kangaroos! I want to know what others think aswell, this is interesting as the US is seeing trends that are really queuing up a recession or even complete crash. Here‚Äôs an award since this is something im intrigued about. In a recession you see decreased economic productivity, company profits decrease, they lay off workers, who in turn spend less, leading to less economic productivity. The Fed is supposed to step in here by lowering interest rates, which stimulates lending, allowing companies to finance activity and in theory keep workers employed.

Since rates are at 0, the alternative is to directly stimulate spending by sending out stimulus checks. This requires political consensus. Therefore this will not happen. 

We will likely see negative interest rates, which the Fed can do directly and does not require political consensus. This will cause investors to move away from bonds even more, and toward assets like bitcoin. Probably some degree of yield curve control on the treasuries as well, which will weaken the dollar.

There may be punctuations throughout this process where investors pull liquidity and the price crashes, but on the whole I think the narrative for bitcoin gets stronger. As other fiat currencies collapse, citizens of those nations will turn to bitcoin for economic protection. We see this already in African and South American nations. This is a great question because it highlights just how similar to bitcoin and gold can be. In a drawdown, gold will rise as people look for safe harbors. Thus, if the market really sees bitcoin as a store of value replacement of gold, it should rise as well. However, if there is a lot of speculation in the market, which it looks like currently, you‚Äôll get a big drawdown in bitcoin as well. If people were in need of liquidity you would likely see a decrease in price as people sell I have been wondering this question for a while.

especially before its adopted by the masses...

its almost safer to just adopt crypto and a stable coin for the masses. we need to adapt and change before FIAT fails us in a glorious fire ball.

worst case scenario is being stuck without a backup plan for fiat. growth sectors tend to suffer inflows during general recession. but govt also tends to print more money during recessions, and bitcoin is a perfect place to be when they do.  look at what happened during the market crash of 2020. bitcoin crashed by 60% then rallied 2000%, only to correct to 1000%. It is still a risk-on asset therefore it would get beat down pretty hard. The stock market is due for a correction this year. Like crypto to much leverage. I believe they will see a 20 to 25% correction which in turn will bring crypto down also.  That may be the start as we are poised for it. The we will probably see a bear market for a year or more. Just my opinion. It will probably drop. It shouldn‚Äôt but it probably will What usually happens is a big and sudden drop of asset prices, as people are in need of cash. This is almost certain, as it happened quite often in the past - but of course, we cannot expect things to be like in the past. Nevertheless, there is some logic to this, too. Asset prices are insanely inflated and we certainly are in a bubble of epic proportions. But who knows when things burst; tomorrow? In five years? Nobody does.

It also heavily depends on how unemployment, price inflation and interest rates behave. If you have a severe recession and even a stagflation, it can very well be that even cryptos drop massively. Why? Well, how will real interest rates behave? Even though many people model this and try to predict where interest rates will go, let it be clear once and for all: It is impossible to predict this. Who knows how the Federal Reserve will react? Let price inflation hit two digit percentages and we will see if they keep blowing up their balance sheets. This might very well be and if so, raw materials and serious crypto currencies would benefit from this. But what if the Federal Reserve decides an interest rate spike - knowing that this will blow up many overleveraged companies and also make the burden on the US government larger. But on the other hand, this might help stabilising the US Dollar. By the way, this happened when Paul Volcker was Fed Chairman. The difference is that today there are more debt burdens on companies and people (and the government). In the end, nobody knows: Who will be Fed Chairman if this happens? How will the Chairman think about this? Trying to predict interest rates also boils down on predicting the thoughts and decisions of people running the Fed.

Conclusion: Long run, serious cryptos should be great, as fiat currencies do not last forever, it is bad and sick 'money'. But during the next recession? Impossible to predict. In my view, if we will see a sudden crash (not so unprobable...) in asset prices, it will heavily affect the crypto market. These are the best times to buy. BTC seems to follow the US stock exchange. So in a recession I see btc dropping. When people start getting laid off they sell their btc for liquidity. Just want to add that this is the sort of thought-provoking content I'd like to see more of on this sub. Bitcoin will crash...People will have limited money to invest in risky assets. I want to see continual volume expansion which is what is happening right now Recession Bitcoin is the way out something that is not control but by the people A opportunity *wolf of Wall Street mic grab* TO FUCKING BUY!!!!!!!! My thoughts are it crashes with the economy. However, if the USD loses its position as the world currency after the economic downturn and is replaced by bitcoin it‚Äôll go to the moon. That is a real possibility given the history and timelines of fiat currencies. The response you'd see is me continuing to add regularly. Bitcoin is in collaboration with the movement of the markets.  Give or take 6-12 months Idc how bad it gets, I‚Äôll start an of for money before I sell off any btc üòÖ To put it succinctly, I have full faith that Bitcoin will do well in the next recession assuming it's left well alone by governments.

If you have wealth and see your investments drop in value you rotate to safer investments that can hold their value during a downturn.  This is called the ""flight to safety"".

Bitcoin was created from the ashes of the 2008 Great Recession.    It will start (well already has started) by the ""smart money"" moving into Bitcoin.  When there's blood on the streets, a sea of red ticker symbols, and you see that one green BTC ticker on MSNBC - the flood will commence.  It just becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy at that point.  All IMHO though. Legit saw what happened not to long ago. US still in recession technically btw. I guess it would largely depend on how much money the government printed. I think in a market shock people are going to liquidate assets and keep cash close for emergencies like getting layed off etc and as such we'll watch the crypto and stock markets crumble, but, much like March 2020 I see a very real possibility that crypto recovers faster. I don't have an actual clue so I park some extra cash every payday I think that BTC and all crypto high volatility wouldn‚Äôt make BTC a popular investment during those hard times. bitcoin crashes 60% Recessions are cancelled forever..

Just want to try it out https://staging.lightning.engineering/sidecar-channel-blog/posts/2021-05-25-sidecar-channels/

When you want to onboard a stranger/friend onto Bitcoin, you can just send them some coins on-chain. If they then want to use LN, they need to do another transaction to (possibly) move those funds into an LN wallet, then open a channel.

What we've released today lets your friend _skip_ the normal on-chain flow and go _directly_ to Layer 2 (Lightning). Under the hood, it uses [Pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool/) to source a liquidity provider (who is ideally a well connected and well run routing node) to open an initial channel to them in an atomic operation. The channel opened may even have funds on both sides to let your friend receive/send using the channel as soon as it's confirmed.

As all operations on Pool are batched together in a single transaction, in aggregate more people can be on boarded onto w/ less chain fees spent compared to if they all did it by themselves in isolation. How profitable is it to run a lightning node? Can I easily deploy some BTC to generate income, like lending on DeFi? Hi,

TLDR: Is it possible to use LN to accept payments only and withdraw to layer1 btc? 

----------
In 2017 bull run I got interested in lightning. Created a lightning wallet and experimented with it made some purchases online.

It workwd very well and fees were nearly 0. So far I was very happy with that.

But when I wanted to use lightning to accept payment in my bussiness it became a problem.

If I want to accept payments in LN I have to first lock my bitcoins ans SPEND THEM to free up space so I cam recieve money from someone else. That was really unusable.

I was able to solve this by using a 3rd party servise which holds btc on LN for me. But I can again only spend it, I am not able to turn it back to layer1 btc.

Is there an easy solution now or is it still the same? 

I guess If i operate my own LN node it would be different but I am not an IT guy I am looking for easy solutions üòâ and we need easy solutions if we want more people to use btc and lightning. I'm not too tech savvy but I want to contribute to the LN. Is there a ready-to-run solution for LN nodes, that I can run on windows server or something? Never used linux yet. I could get my hands on a cheap mac mini (MY2010) that i would like to use to run a node. I'm ok to do a clean install of ubuntu on it, so i won't be using OSX. is this a good idea or should i rather go the raspberry pi route like most people? Hi there. How would a little website set up a Bitcoin node to allow customers pay through the lightning network?

You can choose to keep half/sell half then buy again to accumulate. A better strategy would be to hold the bitcoin and play the altcoin market. If you are buying and selling be sure to have a strategy. If you can create a sell order at a reasonable price target and stick to it then buy again when it falls/create a buy order for a target level and walk away then you will do well.

496;PayPal to Let Users Send Bitcoin Off PayPal;nlmz3a;2557;1622051262.0;TobiHovey;;76;"This is pretty big! Paypal is way bigger than any exchange, so this opens up a lot more people to be able to hold their own coins. It might also put pressure on other places like Robinhood to do the same. Any wallet that doesn't implement this will be left in the dust. Is this not another layer 2 implementation? This is BULLSHIT. I mean, BULLISH As awesome as it is for a company as large as PayPal to do this, I get cold sweats when I have $100 in my PayPal account that they are gonna lock it randomly for 3 months and do an investigation because I received the money during a waning moon.


I couldn‚Äôt imagine holding any sort of crypto on a PayPal hot wallet, I‚Äôd be a nervous wreck. Fucking finally. Put some money there before I knew better and have been sitting on it. Well it defeats the purpose of BTC by not letting ppl send shit anywhere in the first place but I get why, still a form of hodling lol >PayPal and Venmo users will **soon** be able to send Bitcoin to each other and to other platforms.

not so fast! they ain't letting customers do shit. Don't believe it till it happens. Robinhood's been pitching the same lie for a long time. PayPal permanently banned my account and stole $800 off me about 5 years ago because I gave someone Bitcoin in exchange for money. Said it was against their T&Cs. Screw these guys That‚Äôs a good move by PayPal. Pretty much all the major platforms will have this feature prob by the end of this year. This is huge. You can pay for anything with Paypal. No more workarounds, giftcards, getting ripped off so you can pay with crypto. We've been waiting for Amazon to start accepting crypto.... well this is just as good.

The only thing left is to update the tax code so we dont have to report every single small transaction to the IRS. Then it's game over. Dont have to worry about clogging up the blockchain with small transactions.  Paypal and others like them can settle all that internally then just use the blockchain for large transactions. This is great for the average person to have that option, we were all new to bitcoin at one stage or another. Hell yeah great news Is all falling in to place. This is great news but the amount of scammed people will be staggering. tldr; PayPal will be adding support for third-party wallet transfers, PayPal's head of blockchain and crypto, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, said on Wednesday. Users will be able to send Bitcoin to others on PayPal and Venmo, and to services like Coinbase and to outside crypto wallets as well. PayPal declined to provide further details about when specifically PayPal would roll out the new service.{}

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* BOOM. And the dominoes continue to fall, soon at ‚Äúhockey-stick‚Äù pace :) PayPal is awful and loves to hold your money in custody by coming up with all sorts of excuses on why they‚Äôre the ones protecting you. Regardless this would be great and more education needs to happen on what buying and owning/holding your coin actually means. 

People should only be buying Bitcoin that they can withdraw to their own wallet for self custody. The end result would mean less volatility and more power to the retail investor by being your own bank. 

Not your keys... not your coins! Woah this is a great development This is bullish. right and then perma lock lol But when can I start using PayPal to let people buy items off my e-commerce site using their crypto. That‚Äôs the real thing I‚Äôm hoping for. PayPal is a bunch of crooks. I hadn't used my account too much and only had about $100 in it. When I wanted to make use of it they started to ask me for verification that I was I. Things like identity card, residence papers, even a fresh copy of my bank account. My account is still in limbo and there is no way to communicate with them. They simply stopped responding win the case remaining open. When I told a friend about this, i learnt that PayPal had robbed him in the exact same manner. ""We hate Elon"", but we love PayPal, bunch of hipocrites. They have behaved deceptively.  I'd NEVER trust them. PayPal will probably reverse this as soon as they get flooded by complaints from people who screw up their own wallets.  

""I can't remember my seed phrase this is your fault PayPal"".

If people being their own banks was a good idea the banking system would've never have started im the first place. That's the case for most people. ...or just use a real exchange. Buying Bitcoin on PayPal is cringe AF. Nice move! Sooooonnnnnn Super bullish!!! I think thats big news, will it impact the value of btc? also, now it will be provable who owns an address or? The End must be Near. do you have to be over 18? half of America cannot tell the difference btw amounts of 100 vs 1, as evident with their continual belief of election fraud numbers.  And you want them to understand the differences when digits and fractional digits are involved Cash app is doing the same Will it mean KYC and 2FA requirements?

Opened my Paypal account years ago so will I need to go through a verification?

Can't use it for crypto yet in New Zealand but it will get here eventually I guess. This is what I'd call tainted, non-fungible coins. OK good, let's get BTC to 100k I thought this would influence the value of btc, but apparently no great news, the more adoption the better for the world Paypal can and will ban accounts for any reason and steal your money.   They took over 300 from a friend of mine because someone he paid did something against the terms of service. Not him but the other person. That‚Äôs messed up. So, Ill be able to send my BTC to my Paypal account and then transfer it to fiat? If it works like that it will be huge! Fiat They bought the dip, and expect bitcoin to go up.

When new guys buy at higher price and wants coins, they will send the ones they bought last week. Nice. I havent used paypal because of this reason. Why don't eBay let us buy stuff with crypto.

&#x200B;

Its going to be unavoidable if you want to survive as years go on with FIAT/overlords inflating to self destruction. Do it before it does you js. Yugeeeeee üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞ does this mean I Can send crypto from PayPal to coinbase? Or binance? Yes, more dispersion into alts. Finally oh wow, something I didn't see coming. dudes what do u think about MRJOBSFINDER? They r creating a revolutionary BSC based ecosystem with a burning mechanism and MRJF token. lookms like a really! Good start for the team, what do you think? Nice. Bullish great news PayPal offering btc makes me a bit bearish on coinbase... though I'm not sure that's right. 50% down after ipo... it kind of feels like fb ipo again. But none of it seems as good as just hodling btc. I wonder what their withdrawal fee will be. More of this is going to be so key to crypto eye opening.

Buying crypto and keeping it on an central exchange is like buying a fancy car and having CarMax park it on your behalf in their showroom. Yea until they decide they dont like the products you're selling, ban you, and potentially steal whatever's in your account at the time. it's about time I‚Äôm feeling skeptical about this, just hope it doesn‚Äôt give us robinhood-ish compliants If you are thinking where to buy and hold Shiba and Akita - Gate.io is a great exchange with bonuses for new registrations https://www.gate.io/signup/4584780 # * Before the end of looters bubbles games . * They don‚Äôt even have costumer service for dumb shit whilst arbitrarily locking peoples accounts. 

Paypal needs to catch up, not only with crypto. CashApp already does this Wow What are the fees like on PayPal? This is a step in the right direction, but are they still limiting bitcoin purchase to US paypal users? I couldn't find that but Bitcoin purchases were a US thing only. Unless you want your money got taken & locked out randomly without a notice, go ahead and use paypal. All the convenience of paying with Paypal with extra steps. Love it. If the fees are not competitive why would anyone bother using paypal or venmo to buy crypto? Excellent! A new way for Elon to manipulate the token! Very cool Elon! will we be able to send Bitcoin straight from PayPal to cold storage or will we have to go thru an exchange like Coinbase first? Makes no difference.  Pretty soon the bitcoin network will choke when China pulls a plug on it. Like sending to a hardware wallet ? That would be VERY good for mass adoption and makes it even easier to access (who does NOT have a paypal account here ? ) Prince John. Little Jon was Robin Hood‚Äôs best friend/2nd in command of the Merry Men, AKA the bear in the Disney version."

His full MIT course on crypto is renowned, and available for free on the internet. Fuck them. Them making the dollar a disaster is why bitcoin is made in the first place. They can't regulate Bitcoin.  

They can only regulate their own fiat currency within their own country. I think regulation is good for btc. Like regulation has positive sides too, like adoption among other things is normalizing btc good? or should it be a rogue asset"
498;How to sell bitcoin as a Will Executor;nksxwu;3;1621957826.0;SluDge1;"Sadly, a family friend past away.  Among his possessions was a keyfob and some hand written papers about recovery passwords for Bitcoin and Ethereum.  He didn't leave much more information than that ( don't know what exchange he used or what computer to buy/sell).

As the executor of the will, how do you access the coins and sell them for fiat?

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks.";6;"Don‚Äôt tell anyone them. WhT you want to do is find a wallet that is trusty worthy and recover the crypto using said wallet. Then send it to a major exchange. Check his papers they may list a exchange. IGNORE EVERYONE TRYING TO ‚ÄúHELP‚Äù YOU!! Unless he was specific, you might want to consult with the heirs to determine if they even want it converted.  It would probably be easier for everyone involved, to deal with coins as is. you'll have to find where his bitcoin is stored, or you can do nothing.  

you need to find logins for exchanges (in the US, there's coinbase, kraken, gemini, and paxos. some idiots use binance or robinhood), or bip-39 mnemonics written on paper (or less likely paper wallet formats with private keys), or software wallets installed on his computer (and the passwords you'll need), or physical bitcoin hardware wallets with their pin number. Sorry for your loss! :(

First, if you are new to crypto I cannot stress this enough: keep the recovery passwords safe and do NOT give them to anyone especially in a reddit DM. Anyone with access to the 12 or 24 words will have access to the funds. 

What does the keyfob look like? Like this perhaps?  
[https://www.ledger.com/](https://www.ledger.com/)  


When you say recovery password, is it a string of 12 or 24 random words? First of all - sorry for your loss! 

Please be careful and do not reply on any DM because people are grasping any chance to scam each other for BTC. Never post / share the password or code you have received. 

Do you know if the passwords you received are longstrings of text (private key) or (24 different words?) or a simple password? I don't believe you. You stole someones seed and HW"
499;Holding the Keys to Retirement Bitcoin with KeyKeeper IRA and Unchained Capital;nlop83;1;1622055731.0;unchainedcap;;1;"The way I see it, Bitcoin separates money and state. Bitcoin is a precious gift where we can have a form of money that is ""strong"" (even better than gold), can be sent to anywhere over the Internet, and (when stored properly) cannot be confiscated. No government can tell us if or when we can send Bitcoin to somebody else, nor can they dictate to whom we are ""allowed"" to send money, or how much. No government, no central bank can ""print"" Bitcoin and devalue it, like they've been doing to their fiat currencies.

Bitcoin offers us ""freedom of money"".

An IRA locks your money/wealth in a government ""jail"". They tell you all the rules: how much you can put in, when you can put it in, when you can take it out, how much you can take out, when you must take it out... they can change the rules on you after your money has been locked up. Furthermore, they will eventually confiscate it.

""Oh, but tax deferral and ... "" Stop! Think...

The long-term average ROI for Bitcoin is about 100% per year.

Leave your fiat money in the IRA/ROTH/401K (if employer matched). Leave your Bitcoins in your own wallet, and add more Bitcoins as you are able to do so ""responsibly"". Be patient. In several years, your Bitcoin stash is likely to be worth millions of dollars. If you store it properly, the government cannot take it from you.

If you get old and want to buy something with your Bitcoins, say, a home, then you can pay long-term capital gains, about 20%. Think about it: you put in thousands which turned into millions and now you gotta pay one fifth as tax. So, you can only spend 4 million instead of 5 - boo, fucking hoo for you, so blue, go to the zoo, step in penguin poo...

If the taxes bother you that much, don't buy that home, rent it instead, and pay the landlord in satoshis. Leave the government out of it.

Or, if taxes bother you that much, wait an extra year or two, then your stash will likely be worth 10 million instead of 5. You pay the 20% tax and you have 8 million bucks. Only eight million.. boo fucking hoo for you...

There is no good reason to complicate your life and to risk losing all your IRA custodial Bitcoins to a hack, a crime, changing laws, or outright government confiscation."
